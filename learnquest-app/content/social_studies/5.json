            "explanation": "After the French and Indian War (1754-1763), Britain had spent a great deal of money defending the colonies and decided the colonists should help pay for it. Britain began passing new taxes on the colonies, including the Sugar Act (1764), which taxed sugar and molasses, and the Stamp Act (1765), which required colonists to pay a tax on printed materials like newspapers, legal documents, and playing cards. The colonists were outraged because they had no representatives in the British Parliament — the government body that passed these taxes. They protested with the rallying cry 'No taxation without representation!' In 1767, the Townshend Acts placed taxes on glass, lead, paint, paper, and tea. Colonists organized boycotts, refusing to buy British goods. Groups like the Sons of Liberty, led by Samuel Adams, organized protests. Tensions continued to build between the colonists who wanted more freedom and the British government that wanted to maintain control over its colonies.",

            "explanation": "Several major events pushed the colonies closer to revolution. On March 5, 1770, British soldiers in Boston fired into an angry crowd, killing five colonists. This event became known as the Boston Massacre and was used as propaganda to turn colonists against Britain. In 1773, Parliament passed the Tea Act, which gave a British company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies. On December 16, 1773, colonists disguised as Mohawk Indians boarded British ships and dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor. This famous act of protest became known as the Boston Tea Party. In response, Britain passed the Intolerable Acts in 1774, which closed Boston Harbor, banned town meetings, and forced colonists to house British soldiers. These harsh punishments angered colonists across all thirteen colonies, not just Massachusetts. In September 1774, delegates from twelve colonies met at the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia to discuss how to respond to Britain's actions. They agreed to continue boycotts and to meet again if the situation did not improve.",

            "explanation": "The American Revolution began on April 19, 1775, when British soldiers marched from Boston to Lexington and Concord, Massachusetts to seize colonial weapons. At Lexington, they were met by about 70 colonial militia called minutemen — ordinary citizens trained to be ready to fight at a minute's notice. Someone fired the 'shot heard round the world,' and eight minutemen were killed. The British continued to Concord, but more minutemen had gathered, and they forced the British to retreat back to Boston, firing at them from behind trees and stone walls the entire way. In June 1775, the Battle of Bunker Hill (actually fought on Breed's Hill) showed that the colonists could stand up to the professional British army, even though the British eventually captured the hill. The Second Continental Congress met in May 1775 and chose George Washington to lead the new Continental Army. Washington, a Virginia planter and experienced military leader, would face the enormous challenge of turning inexperienced farmers and shopkeepers into an army that could defeat the most powerful military in the world.",

It was read by hundreds of thousands of people and helped turn public opinion in favor of independence. In June 1776, the Second Continental Congress asked Thomas Jefferson to write a document explaining why the colonies should be free. Jefferson, with help from Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, wrote the Declaration of Independence. The document declared that 'all men are created equal' and that people have 'unalienable rights' to 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' It listed the colonists' grievances against King George III and declared the thirteen colonies to be free and independent states. On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress officially adopted the Declaration. Signing it was an act of courage — if the Revolution failed, the signers could be executed for treason.

The Continental Army faced many challenges: soldiers lacked training, supplies, warm clothing, and food. The winter of 1777-1778 at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania was especially brutal — soldiers endured freezing cold, hunger, and disease. But Washington held the army together, and a Prussian officer named Baron von Steuben trained the soldiers into a more effective fighting force. A turning point came in October 1777 when the Americans won the Battle of Saratoga in New York. This victory convinced France to enter the war as an ally of the Americans, providing soldiers, money, and naval support. Other individuals also made important contributions: Marquis de Lafayette, a young French nobleman, fought alongside Washington; Deborah Sampson disguised herself as a man to fight; and thousands of African Americans served in the Continental Army. The final major battle took place at Yorktown, Virginia in October 1781, where Washington's army and French forces trapped the British army under General Cornwallis, who surrendered.

Congress could declare war and make treaties, but it could not collect taxes, regulate trade between states, or enforce its laws. There was no president and no national court system. Each state acted almost like an independent country, printing its own money and making its own trade rules. The problems became clear quickly: the national government had no money because it could not tax, it could not pay soldiers or debts from the Revolution, and states argued over trade and borders.

They debated for four hot summer months behind closed doors. One of the biggest disagreements was about representation in Congress. Large states wanted representation based on population (the Virginia Plan), while small states wanted equal representation for all states (the New Jersey Plan). Roger Sherman proposed the Great Compromise: Congress would have two houses — the Senate with equal representation (two senators per state) and the House of Representatives with representation based on population. Another compromise dealt with how to count enslaved people for representation, resulting in the shameful Three-Fifths Compromise.",

            "explanation": "The Constitution created a federal government with three separate branches, each with its own powers and responsibilities. The legislative branch is Congress, which makes the laws. Congress has two parts: the Senate (100 members, two per state) and the House of Representatives (435 members, divided based on population). The executive branch is led by the President, who carries out and enforces the laws. The President also serves as commander-in-chief of the military, makes treaties with other countries (with Senate approval), and appoints judges and other officials. The judicial branch is the court system, headed by the Supreme Court. Federal judges interpret the laws and decide if laws follow the Constitution. The framers built in a system of checks and balances so that each branch can limit the others. For example, the President can veto laws passed by Congress, Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds vote, and the Supreme Court can declare laws unconstitutional. This prevents any one branch from becoming too powerful.",

This sparked a fierce debate between two groups. The Federalists, including Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay, supported the Constitution. They argued that a strong national government was necessary to hold the country together and solve national problems. They wrote a series of essays called The Federalist Papers to persuade people to ratify the Constitution. The Anti-Federalists, including Patrick Henry and George Mason, opposed the Constitution because they feared it gave too much power to the national government and did not protect individual rights. They demanded that a bill of rights be added to protect freedoms like speech, religion, and fair trials. After much debate, the Constitution was ratified in 1788, with the understanding that a bill of rights would be added.

This protects people from government overreach. Separation of powers divides the government into three branches so no single group has all the power. Checks and balances gives each branch the ability to limit the others. Federalism divides power between the national (federal) government and state governments. Some powers belong only to the federal government (like printing money and declaring war), some belong only to states (like setting up schools and issuing driver's licenses), and some are shared (like collecting taxes and building roads).

Napoleon Bonaparte, the French leader, sold the territory because he needed money for his wars in Europe and had given up his plans for a French empire in North America. Jefferson then sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on an expedition to explore the new territory. From 1804 to 1806, the Lewis and Clark Expedition traveled from St. Louis to the Pacific Ocean and back. They were helped greatly by Sacagawea, a Shoshone woman who served as an interpreter and guide. The expedition mapped the territory, studied plants and animals, and established contact with many Native American nations. The Louisiana Purchase opened the door for American expansion westward.",

Thousands of families packed their belongings into covered wagons and headed west along trails like the Oregon Trail (to Oregon and Washington), the California Trail (to California), and the Santa Fe Trail (to the Southwest). The journey was incredibly difficult and dangerous. Families faced harsh weather, river crossings, disease (especially cholera), food shortages, and rugged mountain passes. The trip along the Oregon Trail was about 2,000 miles and took four to six months. People went west for many reasons: free or cheap land for farming, gold (especially after the California Gold Rush of 1849), religious freedom (the Mormons settled in Utah), and the hope for a better life. The Gold Rush alone brought over 300,000 people to California. Western expansion also led to new territories and eventually new states joining the Union.",

As settlers moved west, they took over land that Native Americans had lived on for thousands of years. The Indian Removal Act of 1830, signed by President Andrew Jackson, forced Native American nations in the Southeast to relocate to Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). The Cherokee, Creek, Seminole, Chickasaw, and Choctaw were forced to walk hundreds of miles in what became known as the Trail of Tears. During the Cherokee removal in 1838-1839, an estimated 4,000 Cherokee died from cold, hunger, and disease. As settlers continued moving west, similar patterns of displacement, broken treaties, and violence repeated across the Great Plains. Buffalo herds — essential to the survival of Plains peoples — were deliberately destroyed by hunters, with herds declining from tens of millions to near extinction. Native Americans fought to defend their lands, but they were outnumbered and outgunned. By the late 1800s, most Native Americans had been forced onto reservations — small areas of land set aside by the government — far from their ancestral homelands.",

The Northern economy was based more on manufacturing, trade, and small farms that generally did not use enslaved labor. As the nation expanded west, the question of whether new states would allow slavery became explosive. Northerners argued slavery was morally wrong and should not spread. Southerners argued it was their right and essential to their economy. Compromises like the Missouri Compromise (1820) and the Compromise of 1850 temporarily eased tensions, but each compromise satisfied no one fully. The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 led to violent clashes between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers in Kansas, known as 'Bleeding Kansas.' The Dred Scott Supreme Court decision of 1857 ruled that enslaved people were not citizens and had no rights, outraging many Northerners.

Eleven Southern states seceded and formed the Confederate States of America. The Union (the North) had more people, more factories, more railroads, and a stronger navy. The Confederacy (the South) had skilled military leaders, soldiers fighting to defend their homeland, and the advantage of fighting on familiar territory. The war was far longer and bloodier than anyone expected. On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring enslaved people in Confederate states to be free. While it did not immediately free everyone (it only applied to states in rebellion), it changed the purpose of the war — the Union was now fighting not just to preserve the country, but to end slavery. About 180,000 African Americans served in the Union army and navy, fighting bravely for their own freedom and the freedom of others. The Gettysburg Address, Lincoln's famous speech in November 1863, honored the fallen soldiers and rededicated the nation to equality and democracy.",

The war had lasted four years and killed over 620,000 soldiers — more Americans than any other war in history. Just days after the surrender, on April 14, 1865, President Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. The nation was devastated. The period after the war, called Reconstruction (1865-1877), focused on rebuilding the South and integrating formerly enslaved people into society as free citizens. Three important amendments were added to the Constitution: the Thirteenth abolished slavery, the Fourteenth gave citizenship and equal protection to all people born in the US, and the Fifteenth gave Black men the right to vote. During Reconstruction, Black Americans built schools, churches, and communities, and some were elected to political office. However, Reconstruction was cut short, and many of these gains were reversed by racist laws called Jim Crow laws that enforced segregation and denied Black citizens their rights for nearly a century.",

The second wave (1880s-1920s) brought millions from Southern and Eastern Europe — Italians, Poles, Russians, and many Jewish people escaping religious persecution. Chinese immigrants came to the West Coast, many working on the transcontinental railroad. Immigrants came for many reasons: to escape poverty, war, religious persecution, or famine, and to find freedom and opportunity in America. Between 1892 and 1954, over 12 million immigrants passed through Ellis Island in New York Harbor. On the West Coast, Angel Island in San Francisco processed immigrants from Asia.
