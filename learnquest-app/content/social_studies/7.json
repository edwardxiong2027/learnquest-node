            "explanation": "After the Civil War ended in 1865, the nation faced the enormous challenge of rebuilding the South and integrating nearly four million formerly enslaved people into American society. This period, known as Reconstruction (1865-1877), began under President Andrew Johnson and continued under Congressional leadership. The 13th Amendment abolished slavery, the 14th Amendment granted citizenship and equal protection under the law, and the 15th Amendment guaranteed voting rights regardless of race. During Reconstruction, African Americans made significant gains: they held political office, built schools and churches, and established communities. However, Reconstruction also faced fierce resistance from groups like the Ku Klux Klan, and many Southern states passed Black Codes to restrict the freedoms of formerly enslaved people.",

During this era, the United States transformed from a largely agricultural nation into a major industrial power. Innovations like the railroad, steel production, and electricity drove massive economic growth. Powerful businessmen like Andrew Carnegie (steel), John D. Rockefeller (oil), and J.P. Morgan (banking) built enormous fortunes and controlled entire industries. While these 'captains of industry' created jobs and built infrastructure, critics called them 'robber barons' because they often exploited workers, used unfair business practices, and accumulated extreme wealth while many Americans lived in poverty. Millions of immigrants arrived during this period, providing labor for factories and reshaping American culture.",

The Knights of Labor, founded in 1869, was one of the first major unions and welcomed workers of all skill levels, races, and genders. The American Federation of Labor (AFL), led by Samuel Gompers, focused on skilled workers and used collective bargaining and strikes to win better wages and hours. Major strikes like the Haymarket Affair (1886), the Homestead Strike (1892), and the Pullman Strike (1894) drew national attention to workers' struggles, though they were often met with violent suppression by employers and government forces.",

Ida Tarbell exposed Standard Oil's monopolistic practices, and Jacob Riis documented the terrible living conditions of the urban poor. President Theodore Roosevelt became a leading progressive, breaking up trusts, protecting consumers, and conserving natural resources. The era also saw important constitutional amendments: the 16th (income tax), 17th (direct election of senators), 18th (Prohibition), and 19th (women's suffrage).",

After the Civil War, leaders like Susan B. Anthony and Stanton founded the National Woman Suffrage Association. The movement used multiple strategies: petitions, marches, speeches, and civil disobedience. Some states, especially in the West, granted women voting rights before the national amendment. Wyoming became the first territory to grant women suffrage in 1869. By the early 1900s, activists like Alice Paul organized massive parades and pickets at the White House. After decades of persistent effort, the 19th Amendment was ratified on August 18, 1920, granting women the right to vote nationwide.",

Europe was divided into two major alliance systems: the Triple Alliance (Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy) and the Triple Entente (France, Russia, Britain). The spark that ignited the war was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary by a Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip on June 28, 1914.

            "explanation": "World War I introduced a devastating new style of combat: trench warfare. On the Western Front, stretching from Belgium to Switzerland, opposing armies dug elaborate networks of trenches facing each other, separated by a deadly area called 'no man's land.' Soldiers lived in muddy, rat-infested trenches for weeks at a time, enduring constant shelling, disease, and the threat of poison gas attacks. New technologies made WWI uniquely deadly: machine guns could mow down advancing soldiers, artillery shells caused massive casualties, poison gas (chlorine, mustard gas) caused horrific injuries, and barbed wire made advancing nearly impossible. Tanks and airplanes were introduced during the war but were still in early stages.

However, several events pushed America toward joining the conflict. Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare threatened American shipping and lives — most notably the sinking of the British passenger liner Lusitania in 1915, which killed 1,198 people including 128 Americans. In January 1917, British intelligence intercepted the Zimmermann Telegram, a secret message from Germany to Mexico proposing a military alliance against the United States. These events, combined with strong economic ties to Britain and France, led Congress to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917. American troops, called the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) under General John J. Pershing, began arriving in France in mid-1917 and played a crucial role in turning the tide of the war.",

President Wilson proposed his Fourteen Points as a framework for peace, emphasizing self-determination for nations, free trade, open diplomacy, and the creation of a League of Nations to prevent future wars. However, the Treaty of Versailles (1919) was much harsher than Wilson had hoped. It forced Germany to accept sole blame for the war (the 'war guilt clause'), pay enormous reparations, give up territory, and drastically reduce its military.

The 1920s also saw significant social tensions: the Ku Klux Klan experienced a resurgence, targeting not only African Americans but also immigrants, Catholics, and Jewish people.

Taking office in March 1933 during the worst of the Depression, FDR immediately began an ambitious program of government action. During his first 'Hundred Days' in office, he pushed through an unprecedented number of new laws and programs. The New Deal had three goals, sometimes called the 'Three Rs': Relief (immediate help for the suffering), Recovery (getting the economy moving again), and Reform (changing the system to prevent future depressions). Key programs included the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which employed young men in conservation projects; the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which created jobs building roads, bridges, schools, and public art; Social Security, which provided retirement income for the elderly; and the FDIC, which insured bank deposits. While the New Deal did not end the Depression entirely — that would require the economic mobilization of World War II — it provided vital relief, restored hope, and fundamentally changed the role of the federal government in American life.",

The two superpowers represented opposing ideologies: the United States championed democracy and capitalism, while the Soviet Union promoted communism and a state-controlled economy. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill described the divide in a famous 1946 speech, saying an 'iron curtain' had descended across Europe, separating the democratic West from the communist East. The Truman Doctrine (1947) pledged that the U.S. would support free peoples resisting communist takeover, and the Marshall Plan provided billions of dollars in aid to rebuild Western European economies and prevent the spread of communism. The Cold War was called 'cold' because the two superpowers never fought each other directly, but they competed through proxy wars, espionage, propaganda, and an arms race.",

After the U.S. used atomic bombs to end WWII, the Soviet Union tested its first nuclear weapon in 1949, shocking the West. Both nations then raced to build larger and more destructive weapons, including hydrogen bombs hundreds of times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb. By the 1960s, both sides had enough nuclear weapons to destroy each other many times over — a concept called Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), which paradoxically helped prevent nuclear war because both sides knew it would mean total annihilation. The Cold War also extended into space. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite, alarming Americans. The U.S. responded by creating NASA and investing heavily in science education. The Space Race culminated on July 20, 1969, when American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon, fulfilling President Kennedy's ambitious goal.",

After three years of brutal fighting, an armistice was signed that divided Korea along roughly the same line as before — the 38th parallel. No peace treaty was ever signed, meaning the two Koreas are technically still at war. The Vietnam War (1955-1975) was a far more controversial conflict. The U.S. gradually escalated its involvement in South Vietnam to prevent a communist takeover by North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. At its peak, over 500,000 American troops were deployed. The war was deeply unpopular at home, sparking massive anti-war protests. The U.S. withdrew in 1973, and South Vietnam fell to the communists in 1975.

These reforms, while intended to save the Soviet system, actually accelerated its collapse. In 1989, a wave of peaceful revolutions swept across Eastern Europe. The most symbolic moment came on November 9, 1989, when the Berlin Wall — which had divided communist East Berlin from democratic West Berlin since 1961 — was torn down by jubilant crowds.

In 1896, the Supreme Court's Plessy v. Ferguson decision upheld segregation, ruling that 'separate but equal' facilities were constitutional. In reality, conditions were never equal. Beyond legal segregation, African Americans faced widespread discrimination, voter suppression through poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses, and the constant threat of violence, including lynching.

Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote that separate schools were 'inherently unequal' and harmed Black children. Despite the ruling, many Southern schools resisted desegregation — in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1957, nine Black students (the 'Little Rock Nine') needed federal troops to escort them into Central High School. In 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was arrested. Her arrest sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott, a 381-day protest led by a young minister named Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The boycott ended when the Supreme Court ruled that bus segregation was unconstitutional. These events showed that organized, nonviolent resistance could achieve real change.",

            "explanation": "Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. became the most prominent leader of the Civil Rights movement, advocating for change through nonviolent protest and civil disobedience — inspired by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and his Christian faith. King and other activists organized sit-ins at segregated lunch counters, freedom rides to challenge segregated bus travel, and marches to demand voting rights. In August 1963, King delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech before over 250,000 people at the March on Washington, calling for an end to racism and envisioning a future where people would be judged 'not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.' King's leadership helped pressure Congress to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which protected the voting rights of minorities. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Tragically, he was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.",

            "explanation": "While Dr. King is the most well-known civil rights leader, the movement was powered by thousands of activists with diverse strategies and perspectives. Malcolm X, a minister in the Nation of Islam, advocated for Black self-defense, self-reliance, and Black pride. He argued that African Americans should defend themselves 'by any means necessary' and was critical of the nonviolent approach, though he later moderated some of his views after a pilgrimage to Mecca. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) organized young people for sit-ins and voter registration drives in the dangerous Deep South. The Black Panther Party, founded in 1966 by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale, combined community programs (like free breakfast for children) with calls for armed self-defense. Activists like Fannie Lou Hamer fought for voting rights in Mississippi, Medgar Evers organized boycotts before his assassination in 1963, and Ella Baker helped build grassroots organizing that empowered local communities.

The movement also inspired other groups to fight for equality: the women's rights movement, the disability rights movement, the LGBTQ+ rights movement, and the American Indian Movement all drew inspiration from civil rights strategies and ideals. However, the movement's leaders recognized that legal equality alone would not solve deeper issues of economic inequality, segregated housing, and systemic racism.
