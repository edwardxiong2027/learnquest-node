            "explanation": "Government exists to maintain order, provide public services, protect citizens, and establish a framework for resolving disputes. Political philosophers have long debated why governments are necessary. Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) argued in 'Leviathan' that without government, life would be 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short' \u2014 a state of nature where the strong prey on the weak. He believed people surrender some freedom to a sovereign authority in exchange for security (the social contract). John Locke (1632-1704) agreed that government arises from a social contract but argued that people have natural rights \u2014 life, liberty, and property \u2014 that government must protect. If government fails to protect these rights, the people have the right to overthrow it. Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) emphasized that legitimate government depends on the 'general will' of the people and that sovereignty belongs to the citizenry as a whole. These Enlightenment ideas profoundly influenced the American founders, particularly Locke's philosophy, which echoes throughout the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.",

                "explanation": "Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau all described versions of the social contract, but they disagreed on how much power the government should have and what happens when it abuses that power."

                "explanation": "Jefferson's 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' is a paraphrase of Locke's 'life, liberty, and property.' The Declaration's argument for revolution is essentially Locke's theory in action."

            "explanation": "Governments are classified by how power is distributed and exercised. In a direct democracy, citizens themselves vote on all laws and policies \u2014 as practiced in ancient Athens and in modern town meetings and referendums. In a representative democracy (or republic), citizens elect representatives who make laws on their behalf. The United States is a constitutional republic: a representative democracy governed by a supreme law (the Constitution) that limits government power and protects individual rights. Authoritarian governments concentrate power in a single leader or small group, with little or no input from citizens. Totalitarian regimes (like Nazi Germany or Stalinist Russia) go further, seeking to control all aspects of public and private life through propaganda, censorship, secret police, and ideological conformity. Oligarchies are controlled by a small, wealthy elite. Theocracies are governed by religious leaders according to religious law. Constitutional monarchies (like the United Kingdom) retain a monarch as head of state but vest governing power in elected parliaments. Understanding these distinctions is essential for evaluating how different systems protect (or fail to protect) individual freedom, equality, and justice.",

            "explanation": "The Enlightenment (17th-18th centuries) was an intellectual revolution that emphasized reason, individual rights, and the questioning of traditional authority. Beyond Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, several other thinkers profoundly shaped modern government. Baron de Montesquieu (1689-1755) argued in 'The Spirit of the Laws' that government power should be separated into legislative, executive, and judicial branches to prevent tyranny \u2014 an idea directly adopted in the US Constitution. Voltaire (1694-1778) championed freedom of speech and religious tolerance, arguing that diverse opinions strengthen rather than weaken society. His quote, 'I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it' (attributed to him), captures the essence of free speech protection. Thomas Paine, though not a philosopher in the traditional sense, wrote 'Common Sense' (1776) and 'The Rights of Man' (1791), making Enlightenment ideas accessible to ordinary people. The American and French Revolutions were direct applications of Enlightenment philosophy: the belief that government should be based on reason, consent, and the protection of natural rights.",

            "explanation": "Today's world features a spectrum of political systems, from full democracies to absolute dictatorships. The Democracy Index (published by the Economist Intelligence Unit) classifies countries into four categories: full democracies (like Norway, Canada, and New Zealand), flawed democracies (like the United States, India, and Brazil), hybrid regimes (like Turkey and Nigeria), and authoritarian regimes (like China, Russia, and North Korea). Full democracies feature free elections, protected civil liberties, independent courts, and a free press. Flawed democracies have genuine elections but problems like political polarization, erosion of institutions, or limitations on press freedom. Hybrid regimes mix democratic and authoritarian elements \u2014 elections occur but may be unfair, and opposition faces restrictions. Authoritarian regimes suppress opposition, control media, and concentrate power. Federal systems (US, Germany, India) divide power between national and regional governments; unitary systems (France, Japan) concentrate power nationally. Parliamentary systems (UK, Canada) link the executive to the legislative majority; presidential systems (US, Brazil) separate the two. Understanding these variations helps citizens evaluate their own system and engage with global politics.",

            "explanation": "The US Constitution, the supreme law of the land, is organized into seven articles that establish the structure and powers of the federal government. Article I creates the Legislative Branch (Congress), granting it the power to make laws, levy taxes, regulate commerce, declare war, and control spending. It establishes the bicameral structure: the House of Representatives (based on population, 2-year terms) and the Senate (equal representation, 6-year terms). Article II establishes the Executive Branch, headed by the President, who serves as commander-in-chief, conducts foreign policy, appoints federal judges and officials, and enforces the laws. The President serves 4-year terms and is elected through the Electoral College. Article III creates the Judicial Branch, headed by the Supreme Court, which interprets laws and determines their constitutionality. Justices serve life terms for judicial independence. Article IV governs relations between states (requiring states to respect each other's laws and court decisions). Article V establishes the amendment process (requiring two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of state legislatures). Article VI contains the Supremacy Clause, making the Constitution the supreme law above all state laws. Article VII established the ratification process.",

The Bill of Rights (Amendments 1-10, ratified 1791) protects fundamental freedoms. The Reconstruction Amendments (13th, 14th, 15th) abolished slavery, established equal citizenship, and protected voting rights. The Progressive Era produced four amendments: the 16th (income tax, 1913), 17th (direct election of senators, 1913), 18th (Prohibition, 1919), and 19th (women's suffrage, 1920). The 18th Amendment is the only one ever repealed \u2014 by the 21st Amendment (1933). The 22nd Amendment (1951) limits presidents to two terms. The 24th Amendment (1964) banned poll taxes, and the 26th Amendment (1971) lowered the voting age to 18 during the Vietnam War era, reflecting the argument that those old enough to fight should be old enough to vote. The 27th Amendment (1992) \u2014 originally proposed in 1789 \u2014 prevents Congress from giving itself an immediate pay raise.

The executive checks the legislature through the veto power and checks the judiciary through the appointment of judges. The judicial branch checks both other branches through judicial review \u2014 the power to declare laws or executive actions unconstitutional \u2014 established by the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison (1803). Chief Justice John Marshall's landmark ruling declared that 'it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.' This power, not explicitly stated in the Constitution, has become one of the judiciary's most important functions.

            "explanation": "Federalism \u2014 the division of power between national and state governments \u2014 is a defining feature of American governance. The Constitution grants specific 'enumerated powers' to the federal government (such as regulating interstate commerce, coining money, declaring war, and managing foreign relations). The Tenth Amendment reserves all other powers to the states or the people ('reserved powers'), including education, criminal law, marriage, and most business regulation. 'Concurrent powers' are shared by both levels, including taxation, building roads, and establishing courts. The Necessary and Proper Clause (also called the 'elastic clause') gives Congress the power to make laws 'necessary and proper' for carrying out its enumerated powers, allowing federal authority to expand over time. Throughout American history, the balance between federal and state power has shifted. The Civil War established federal supremacy. The New Deal dramatically expanded federal authority over the economy. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 asserted federal power over state discrimination laws. Today, issues like marijuana legalization, immigration enforcement, and environmental regulation continue to test the boundaries of federalism.",

Senators were originally chosen by state legislatures but have been directly elected since the 17th Amendment (1913). The Senate's smaller size and longer terms are designed to encourage deliberation and insulate senators from short-term political pressures. The House of Representatives has 435 members apportioned among the states based on population (determined by the census every 10 years), serving two-year terms. The House was designed to be the 'people's chamber,' more responsive to public opinion because of frequent elections. The Speaker of the House \u2014 currently the most powerful person in Congress \u2014 presides over the House and controls its agenda. The Vice President serves as President of the Senate but votes only to break ties. The Senate Majority Leader is the most influential senator, controlling the Senate's legislative calendar.",

The bill is assigned to a relevant committee, where most legislation dies \u2014 committees decide which bills merit full consideration. If a committee approves, the bill goes to the full chamber for debate. In the House, the Rules Committee sets the terms of debate (how long, which amendments are allowed). In the Senate, debate is unlimited unless 60 senators vote for 'cloture' to end a filibuster \u2014 an extended speech designed to delay or block a vote. If both chambers pass different versions, a conference committee reconciles them into a single bill. Both chambers must approve the identical final version. The bill then goes to the President, who can sign it into law, let it become law without signing (after 10 days), veto it, or (if Congress adjourns) pocket veto it. Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds vote in both chambers. Of the thousands of bills introduced each session, fewer than 5% become law.",

            "explanation": "Committees are where the real work of Congress happens. Standing committees are permanent bodies that specialize in specific policy areas: the House Ways and Means Committee handles tax policy; the Senate Judiciary Committee oversees the federal courts; the Armed Services Committees handle defense policy; and Appropriations Committees control government spending. Each committee is chaired by a member of the majority party, giving that party significant agenda-setting power. Select committees are temporary bodies created to investigate specific issues (like the January 6th Committee). Joint committees include members from both chambers and handle administrative or investigative tasks. Subcommittees focus on narrow topics within a standing committee's jurisdiction. The committee system allows Congress to divide its massive workload among specialized groups with relevant expertise. However, it also concentrates power in committee chairs and creates opportunities for special interests to influence legislation in less visible settings. Committee assignments are highly coveted \u2014 members seek positions on committees that serve their constituents' interests and their own policy goals.",

The Commerce Clause \u2014 giving Congress power to regulate interstate commerce \u2014 has been interpreted broadly to justify federal regulation of everything from civil rights to environmental protection. Congress also holds the 'power of the purse,' controlling all federal spending through the appropriations process. The war power gives Congress the sole authority to declare war, though presidents have increasingly used military force without formal declarations. Constitutional limitations on Congress include: the Bill of Rights (which restricts what laws Congress can make), the requirement that spending bills originate in the House, the prohibition on ex post facto laws (laws that criminalize past actions) and bills of attainder (laws punishing specific individuals without trial), and the Supreme Court's power of judicial review to strike down unconstitutional legislation.",

Key departments include: State (foreign affairs), Treasury (economic policy and taxes), Defense (military), Justice (law enforcement, headed by the Attorney General), Education, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security. Beyond the Cabinet, the federal bureaucracy includes independent agencies like the CIA, NASA, EPA, and Federal Reserve; independent regulatory commissions like the FCC and SEC; and government corporations like the Postal Service and Amtrak.

Its most important power \u2014 judicial review, established in Marbury v. Madison (1803) \u2014 allows it to declare laws and executive actions unconstitutional, making it the ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. The Court receives approximately 7,000 petitions per year but agrees to hear only about 70-80 cases, chosen through the 'rule of four' (four justices must agree to hear a case). Cases typically involve constitutional questions, federal law interpretation, or conflicts between states. The Court's decisions set precedent that all lower courts must follow. Justices are often described as 'conservative' or 'liberal,' but they may surprise observers with unexpected rulings. The appointment process has become intensely political, as justices can shape law for decades. The Court's legitimacy depends on public perception that it decides cases based on law rather than politics \u2014 a perception that is increasingly contested.",

Brown v. Board of Education (1954) overturned Plessy, ruling school segregation unconstitutional. Gideon v. Wainwright (1963) established the right to a lawyer for criminal defendants who cannot afford one. Miranda v. Arizona (1966) required police to inform suspects of their rights before interrogation ('You have the right to remain silent...'). Roe v. Wade (1973) established a constitutional right to abortion, which was overturned by Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), returning the issue to states. Citizens United v.

            "explanation": "The First Amendment protects five fundamental freedoms: religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition. The Establishment Clause prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or favoring one religion over another (the 'wall of separation between church and state'). The Free Exercise Clause protects individuals' right to practice their religion without government interference. Freedom of speech is not absolute \u2014 the Supreme Court has identified categories of unprotected speech, including incitement to imminent lawless action (Brandenburg v. Ohio, 1969), true threats, fighting words, and obscenity. However, political speech, symbolic speech (like wearing armbands or burning flags), and unpopular or offensive speech are protected. Students retain First Amendment rights in school, though they can be limited (Tinker v. Des Moines, 1969: students can wear protest armbands; Bethel v. Fraser, 1986: schools can restrict vulgar speech). Freedom of the press prevents government censorship (prior restraint) except in rare circumstances involving national security. Freedom of assembly protects peaceful protest, and the right to petition allows citizens to formally request government action.",

The exclusionary rule (Mapp v. Ohio, 1961) means evidence obtained through illegal searches cannot be used in court. However, the Court has carved out exceptions: searches incident to arrest, automobile searches (due to mobility), plain view evidence, and consent searches. The digital age has raised new Fourth Amendment questions \u2014 in Carpenter v. United States (2018), the Court ruled that police need a warrant to access cell phone location data. The Fifth Amendment provides multiple protections: the right against self-incrimination (you cannot be forced to testify against yourself \u2014 'pleading the Fifth'), the right to due process (fair legal procedures before the government can deprive you of life, liberty, or property), protection against double jeopardy (being tried twice for the same crime), and the requirement of a grand jury indictment for serious federal crimes. The Takings Clause requires the government to provide 'just compensation' when it takes private property for public use (eminent domain).",

Its Equal Protection Clause requires that states treat all persons equally under the law, and its Due Process Clause prohibits states from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without fair procedures. Through a process called 'incorporation,' the Supreme Court has used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply most of the Bill of Rights to state governments (originally, the Bill of Rights limited only the federal government). The Equal Protection Clause has been the basis for landmark civil rights decisions: Brown v. Board of Education (ending school segregation), Loving v. Virginia (1967, striking down bans on interracial marriage), Reed v. Reed (1971, applying equal protection to gender discrimination), and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015, establishing the right to same-sex marriage). The Court applies different levels of scrutiny to equal protection cases: strict scrutiny for racial classifications (almost always struck down), intermediate scrutiny for gender classifications, and rational basis review for most other classifications.",

            "explanation": "While the Constitution establishes rights, legislation has been necessary to enforce them. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 \u2014 the most comprehensive civil rights law \u2014 banned discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in public accommodations, employment, and federally funded programs. Title VII created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to enforce workplace equality. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 eliminated literacy tests, poll taxes, and other barriers to voting, particularly in the South, and required certain jurisdictions with histories of discrimination to get federal approval before changing voting laws (preclearance). The Fair Housing Act of 1968 banned housing discrimination. The Americans with Disabilities Act (1990) prohibited discrimination against people with disabilities and required reasonable accommodations. Despite these legal protections, disparities persist: racial wealth gaps, unequal school funding, mass incarceration disproportionately affecting communities of color, voter suppression efforts (the Supreme Court weakened the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder, 2013), gender pay gaps, and ongoing debates about affirmative action demonstrate that legal equality and lived equality remain different things.",

The original Constitution left voting qualifications to the states, and most limited suffrage to white male property owners. The 15th Amendment (1870) prohibited denying the vote based on race; the 19th Amendment (1920) guaranteed women's suffrage; the 24th Amendment (1964) banned poll taxes; and the 26th Amendment (1971) lowered the voting age to 18. Despite these expansions, voter turnout in the US remains low compared to other democracies \u2014 typically 50-60% in presidential elections and 35-45% in midterms. Barriers include voter registration requirements (unlike many countries, the US does not automatically register citizens), voter ID laws, limited early voting in some states, felony disenfranchisement (which bars millions from voting), and the practical difficulties of voting on a workday. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was the most significant legislation protecting voting rights, though its enforcement has been weakened. Debates continue over how to balance election security with voter access \u2014 issues like mail-in voting, voter ID requirements, and gerrymandering remain politically charged.",

Each state gets electors equal to its total Congressional delegation (House members + 2 senators), plus 3 for Washington, D.C. (23rd Amendment), totaling 538 electors. A candidate needs 270 electoral votes to win. In 48 states, the candidate who wins the popular vote gets ALL of that state's electoral votes (winner-take-all); Maine and Nebraska use a proportional system. The Electoral College was a compromise at the Constitutional Convention between those who wanted Congress to choose the president and those who wanted a direct popular vote. Critics argue it is undemocratic: a candidate can win the presidency while losing the popular vote (as happened in 2000 and 2016), it effectively ignores voters in 'safe' states as campaigns focus on 'swing states,' and it gives disproportionate weight to small states.

            "explanation": "The United States has had a two-party system throughout most of its history, though the specific parties have changed. Today's two major parties \u2014 the Democratic Party (founded 1828) and the Republican Party (founded 1854) \u2014 dominate elections at every level. The parties differ broadly on policy: Democrats generally favor more government involvement in the economy, stronger social safety nets, environmental regulation, and expansive civil rights protections; Republicans generally favor lower taxes, less regulation, individual liberty, strong national defense, and traditional social values. However, both parties contain diverse factions, and individual politicians may not fit neatly into party stereotypes. Third parties (Libertarian, Green, etc.) struggle because the winner-take-all electoral system makes it nearly impossible for them to win seats. Modern campaigns are enormously expensive: the 2020 presidential campaign cost over $14 billion total. Citizens United v. FEC (2010) allowed unlimited corporate and union spending through Super PACs (Political Action Committees), raising concerns about the influence of money in politics. Campaign strategies rely heavily on data analytics, social media, targeted advertising, and voter mobilization.",

                "explanation": "In proportional representation systems (used in many democracies), a party winning 10% of the vote gets roughly 10% of seats. In the US system, 10% wins nothing, so smaller parties can't build power."

            "explanation": "Media plays a crucial role in democracy by informing citizens, holding government accountable, and shaping public opinion. The evolution from newspapers to radio to television to the internet has dramatically changed how Americans consume political information. The rise of cable news (CNN, Fox News, MSNBC) and social media has created an increasingly fragmented media landscape where people can choose sources that confirm their existing beliefs \u2014 contributing to political polarization. Social media platforms have become primary sources of political information for many Americans, but they also facilitate misinformation, foreign interference in elections, and the creation of 'echo chambers' where users encounter only like-minded views. Public opinion is measured through polling, which influences campaigns, legislation, and government decisions. Civic engagement goes beyond voting: it includes contacting elected officials, attending town halls, joining advocacy groups, volunteering for campaigns, serving on juries, running for office, and engaging in peaceful protest. Research consistently shows that informed, engaged citizens are essential for a healthy democracy \u2014 yet civic participation, particularly among young people, remains lower than in many other democracies.",

Demand is the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices. The Law of Demand states that as price increases, quantity demanded decreases (and vice versa), creating a downward-sloping demand curve. Supply is the quantity that producers are willing and able to sell at various prices. The Law of Supply states that as price increases, quantity supplied increases, creating an upward-sloping supply curve. Market equilibrium occurs where the supply and demand curves intersect \u2014 the price at which the quantity buyers want to purchase exactly equals the quantity sellers want to sell. If the price is above equilibrium, there is a surplus (excess supply), pushing prices down. If below equilibrium, there is a shortage (excess demand), pushing prices up. Shifts in demand (caused by changes in income, preferences, population, or prices of related goods) or shifts in supply (caused by changes in technology, input costs, or number of producers) change the equilibrium price and quantity.",

            "explanation": "Market structure describes how competitive an industry is, ranging from perfect competition to monopoly. In perfect competition, many small firms sell identical products, no single firm can influence the price, and firms can easily enter or exit the market (example: agricultural commodities like wheat). In monopolistic competition, many firms sell similar but differentiated products (restaurants, clothing brands), competing on quality, branding, and advertising as well as price. In an oligopoly, a few large firms dominate the market, and their decisions significantly affect competitors (automobile manufacturers, airlines, wireless carriers). Oligopolies may engage in price leadership (one firm sets the price and others follow) or collusion (illegally agreeing to fix prices). A monopoly exists when a single firm controls the entire market with no close substitutes (historically: Standard Oil, AT&T before breakup). Monopolies can charge higher prices and reduce output because consumers have no alternatives. The government regulates market power through antitrust laws: the Sherman Antitrust Act (1890) and the Clayton Act (1914) prohibit monopolistic practices, and the Federal Trade Commission enforces fair competition.",

Entrepreneurs identify opportunities, take financial risks, organize resources (land, labor, capital), and innovate to create value. The factors of production are land (natural resources), labor (human effort), capital (tools, machinery, technology), and entrepreneurship itself (the ability to combine the other three factors). Businesses operate in three main structures: sole proprietorships (one owner, unlimited liability, simple to start but risky), partnerships (two or more owners sharing profits and risks), and corporations (legal entities separate from their owners, providing limited liability but subject to double taxation and regulation). Profit is the revenue earned minus costs \u2014 the incentive that drives business activity.

GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given period \u2014 the broadest measure of economic activity. When GDP grows, the economy is expanding and creating jobs; when it shrinks for two consecutive quarters, the economy is in a recession. Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level, reducing the purchasing power of money. Moderate inflation (2-3% annually) is considered normal and healthy; high inflation erodes savings and creates economic uncertainty. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures inflation by tracking the prices of a 'basket' of common goods and services. Deflation (falling prices) can be equally harmful, as consumers delay purchases expecting lower prices, reducing business revenue and causing layoffs. Unemployment measures the percentage of the labor force actively seeking but unable to find work. Types include frictional (temporary, between jobs), structural (skills don't match available jobs), cyclical (caused by economic downturns), and seasonal (related to time of year). The 'natural rate' of unemployment is typically 4-5%, reflecting normal frictional and structural unemployment.",

            "explanation": "Governments use two main tools to manage the economy: fiscal policy and monetary policy. Fiscal policy involves government decisions about taxing and spending to influence economic activity. During recessions, the government may use expansionary fiscal policy \u2014 increasing spending or cutting taxes to stimulate demand and create jobs (as FDR did with the New Deal and Congress did after the 2008 financial crisis). During periods of high inflation, contractionary fiscal policy \u2014 reducing spending or raising taxes \u2014 can cool an overheating economy. Fiscal policy is set by Congress and the President through the budget process. Monetary policy involves managing the money supply and interest rates, controlled by the Federal Reserve (the 'Fed'), America's central bank. The Fed's primary tools include: setting the federal funds rate (the interest rate banks charge each other, which influences all other interest rates), open market operations (buying and selling government bonds to increase or decrease the money supply), and setting reserve requirements (the percentage of deposits banks must hold). Lower interest rates encourage borrowing and spending (expansionary); higher rates discourage borrowing and slow spending (contractionary). The Fed operates independently of the President and Congress to insulate monetary policy from political pressure.",

                "explanation": "Think of them as two levers for managing the economy. Fiscal policy directly puts money into (or takes it out of) the economy. Monetary policy influences how easy or expensive it is to borrow money."

            "explanation": "The Federal Reserve System, established by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, serves as the central bank of the United States. It consists of the Board of Governors (7 members appointed by the President to 14-year terms), 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets monetary policy. The Fed has a 'dual mandate' from Congress: maximize employment and maintain stable prices (controlling inflation). The FOMC meets approximately 8 times per year to set the federal funds rate target, its primary policy tool. The Fed also serves as the 'lender of last resort' \u2014 providing emergency loans to banks during financial crises to prevent bank runs and systemic collapse (as it did during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic). It regulates and supervises banks to ensure safety and soundness, processes payments (including clearing checks and facilitating electronic transfers), and issues currency. The Fed's decisions ripple through the entire economy: when it raises rates, borrowing becomes expensive globally; when it lowers rates, asset prices tend to rise. Its chair (currently serving a 4-year term) is among the most powerful economic figures in the world.",

The United States is the world's largest trading nation, with major partners including China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union, and Japan. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA, 1994, replaced by USMCA in 2020) eliminated most tariffs between the US, Canada, and Mexico, creating one of the world's largest free trade zones. The World Trade Organization (WTO) establishes rules for international trade and resolves disputes. Trade agreements remain controversial: supporters argue they lower prices, increase consumer choice, and promote economic growth; critics argue they can lead to job losses in industries that can't compete with cheaper imports, environmental degradation in countries with weak regulations, and exploitation of workers in developing nations. Tariffs (taxes on imports) protect domestic industries but raise prices for consumers. The debate between free trade and protectionism is one of the oldest in American politics, dating back to Hamilton's tariffs and Jefferson's opposition to them.",

            "explanation": "The world's economies operate along a spectrum from pure market (capitalism) to pure command (communism), with most falling somewhere in between as mixed economies. In a market economy, private individuals and businesses make economic decisions based on supply, demand, and the profit motive, with minimal government intervention (no country practices pure capitalism). In a command economy, the government controls all economic decisions \u2014 what to produce, how much, and at what price (practiced in varying degrees by the Soviet Union, North Korea, and Cuba). Most modern economies are mixed: the United States is primarily market-based but with significant government regulation, social programs, and public services. Scandinavian countries like Sweden and Denmark practice social democracy \u2014 a market economy with extensive government-provided healthcare, education, and social safety nets, funded by high taxes. Contemporary economic challenges include: income inequality (the gap between rich and poor has widened significantly since the 1980s), national debt (over $30 trillion), automation and artificial intelligence threatening jobs, climate change requiring massive economic transitions, healthcare costs, and demographic shifts (aging populations straining social programs). How societies address these challenges will depend on the economic systems and policy tools they choose.",

                "explanation": "The US has a mixed economy: businesses operate for profit in a competitive market, but the government regulates industries, provides Social Security, and funds public education and infrastructure."

                "problem": "How do Scandinavian social democracies differ from the US model?",

                "explanation": "These countries consistently rank among the happiest in the world, but their high-tax model is debated: supporters cite quality of life, critics cite reduced economic incentives."

                "problem": "Why is income inequality a concern?",
                "answer": "The widening gap between rich and poor can reduce economic mobility, erode social cohesion, and undermine democratic participation.",
                "explanation": "Since the 1980s, the top 1% of Americans have seen their income grow dramatically while middle-class wages have stagnated. This raises questions about fairness, opportunity, and the sustainability of democratic institutions."
