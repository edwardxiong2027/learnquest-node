The topic is just the subject (like 'dogs'), while the main idea is a complete thought about the topic (like 'dogs make loyal and loving pets'). To find the main idea, ask yourself: 'What is the author mostly telling me about?' Often the main idea is stated in the first or last sentence of a paragraph, but sometimes you have to figure it out by thinking about all the details together.",

Good note-taking means writing down the key facts in your own words, not copying sentences word-for-word. Copying someone else's exact words and pretending they are your own is called plagiarism, and it is like cheating. To avoid plagiarism, read the information, close the source, and write what you remember in your own words. This is called paraphrasing. If you want to use the author's exact words, put them in quotation marks and say where they came from. Always keep track of which source each fact came from.",
