          "content": {
            "explanation": "Tone is the author's attitude toward the subject, the characters, or the reader. Just as a person's tone of voice reveals how they feel when they speak, an author's word choice, sentence structure, and details reveal their attitude in writing. Tone can be formal, informal, sarcastic, humorous, serious, optimistic, pessimistic, critical, admiring, and much more. To identify tone, pay close attention to diction (word choice) — the specific words an author selects carry emotional weight. For example, describing a house as 'cozy' conveys warmth, while calling it 'cramped' conveys discomfort, even though both describe a small space. Tone can shift within a text as the author's attitude changes toward different aspects of the subject.",

              {"problem": "How does word choice (diction) affect tone?", "answer": "Different words for the same thing carry different emotional connotations, shaping the reader's perception of the author's attitude.", "explanation": "'The soldier marched bravely' (admiring tone) versus 'The soldier trudged wearily' (sympathetic tone) — the verbs change everything."}

          "content": {
            "explanation": "Mood is the emotional atmosphere of a text — the feeling it creates in the reader. While tone is the author's attitude, mood is the reader's emotional response. Authors create mood through setting descriptions, imagery, word choice, pacing, and sound devices. A dark, stormy setting with words like 'shadows,' 'creaking,' and 'silence' creates an eerie, suspenseful mood. A sun-drenched meadow with words like 'golden,' 'laughter,' and 'blossoming' creates a cheerful, peaceful mood. Mood can be described with emotion words: tense, joyful, melancholy, romantic, ominous, whimsical, nostalgic, or gloomy. Skilled authors carefully control mood to immerse the reader in the world of the story and make them feel what the characters feel.",

            "explanation": "Irony occurs when there is a contrast between what is expected and what actually happens (or what is said and what is meant). There are three main types of irony in literature. Verbal irony is when a speaker says the opposite of what they mean — similar to sarcasm, but more nuanced. If it is pouring rain and someone says 'What lovely weather,' that is verbal irony. Situational irony is when the outcome of a situation is the opposite of what was expected. A fire station burning down is situational irony. Dramatic irony is when the audience or reader knows something that a character does not, creating tension or humor. In a horror movie, when the audience sees the villain hiding in the closet but the character does not, that is dramatic irony. Authors use irony to add depth, humor, surprise, and complexity to their writing.",

These choices include diction (word choice), syntax (sentence structure), figurative language, point of view, tone, mood, pacing, and literary devices. Analyzing author's craft means examining not just what a text says, but how it says it and why the author made those specific choices. When you analyze craft, ask: Why did the author choose this particular word? Why is this sentence short while the next one is long? Why did the author use this metaphor? What effect does this choice have on the reader? Moving from simply understanding a text to analyzing how and why it was crafted is the key step to becoming a sophisticated reader and a stronger writer yourself.",

              {"problem": "Why might an author use a series of very short sentences during an action scene?", "answer": "Short sentences quicken the pace, create urgency, and mimic the rapid heartbeat of an adrenaline-fueled moment.", "explanation": "This is a syntax choice — the sentence structure physically mirrors the experience of the scene."},
              {"problem": "An author describes a battlefield as 'a garden of steel flowers.' Analyze this.", "answer": "The metaphor contrasts the beauty of a garden with the horror of weapons, creating a disturbing and thought-provoking image that highlights the absurdity of war.", "explanation": "The juxtaposition of something beautiful (garden, flowers) with something deadly (steel, battlefield) forces the reader to confront the contrast."}

            "explanation": "Setting is more than just where and when a story takes place — it can shape characters, drive conflict, reflect themes, and create mood. Authors choose settings deliberately to enhance the meaning of their stories. A story about isolation set in the Arctic tundra uses the harsh, empty landscape to mirror the character's emotional state. A coming-of-age story set in a small town might use the town's boundaries to represent the limits the protagonist is trying to break free from. The historical period of a setting also matters — a story set during the Civil War carries different weight and raises different themes than one set in modern-day suburbia. When analyzing setting, look beyond the physical description and consider what the setting represents and how it influences everything else in the story.",

              {"problem": "How can setting create conflict?", "answer": "A hostile environment (desert, ocean, war zone) can serve as the antagonist, or a restrictive social setting can create interpersonal conflict.", "explanation": "In survival stories, nature itself is the opponent.

            "explanation": "A claim without evidence is just an opinion. In argumentative writing, every claim must be supported by relevant, credible evidence. There are several types of evidence: factual evidence (verified facts and data), statistical evidence (numbers and percentages from research), expert testimony (quotes and opinions from authorities in the field), examples (real-world instances that illustrate your point), and logical reasoning (cause-and-effect connections and deductions). After presenting evidence, you must include reasoning — an explanation of how and why the evidence supports your claim. This is sometimes called the 'warrant' or the 'bridge' because it connects your evidence to your claim. A common formula is: Claim + Evidence + Reasoning (C.E.R.) for each body paragraph.",

Option A is a personal opinion."},

            "explanation": "A strong argumentative essay does not ignore the other side — it acknowledges counterarguments and responds to them with rebuttals. A counterargument is an opposing viewpoint that someone might raise against your claim. A rebuttal is your response to that counterargument, explaining why it is wrong, incomplete, or less valid than your position. Addressing counterarguments actually strengthens your essay because it shows you have considered multiple perspectives and your argument can withstand challenges. Common phrases for introducing counterarguments include 'Some may argue that...' 'Critics might claim...' and 'While it is true that...' For rebuttals, use phrases like 'However, this overlooks...' 'While this may seem valid, the evidence shows...' and 'This argument fails to consider...'",

Group your notes by subtopic — all the evidence about one aspect of your research question goes in one section. Each body paragraph should have a clear topic sentence, evidence from your research (with citations), and your analysis of what that evidence means.

            "explanation": "Media does not just report reality — it shapes how we perceive reality. The stories media chooses to tell (and not tell), the images it shows, the language it uses, and the perspectives it amplifies all influence our understanding of the world. Agenda setting is the media's power to influence what people think about by choosing which stories to cover prominently. Framing is how the media presents a story — the angle or context given that shapes interpretation. Representation matters because when certain groups are consistently portrayed in stereotypical ways (or left out entirely), it affects how society views those groups. Media-literate individuals recognize these influences and actively seek diverse sources and perspectives to form their own informed opinions.",

              {"problem": "If every news channel leads with crime stories, what effect might this have on viewers?", "answer": "Viewers might believe crime is more common and increasing, even if crime rates are actually decreasing — this is agenda setting.", "explanation": "By giving crime stories prominent coverage, media makes viewers think about crime more, which can distort their perception of reality."},
              {"problem": "The same story framed two ways: 'The glass is half full' vs. 'The glass is half empty.' How does framing affect perception?", "answer": "The first frame creates optimism; the second creates pessimism. Same facts, different emotional responses.", "explanation": "Framing determines how the audience interprets information by emphasizing certain aspects over others."},
              {"problem": "Why does representation in media matter?", "answer": "When people see themselves represented accurately and positively in media, it validates their experiences. When groups are stereotyped or absent, it reinforces bias and misunderstanding.", "explanation": "Media shapes what society considers 'normal' and how different groups are perceived."}
