            "explanation": "Postmodern fiction challenges traditional storytelling. Key techniques include: metafiction (fiction about fiction \u2014 the narrator acknowledges the story is a construct), unreliable narrators (whose credibility is compromised), fragmented narrative (non-linear, multiple timelines), pastiche (imitating other styles), and magical realism (magical elements treated as ordinary). Authors like Don DeLillo, Toni Morrison, and David Foster Wallace blur boundaries between high and popular culture. Postmodernism questions whether 'truth' in narrative is even possible.",

Structure: strong opening (hook), clear thesis, organized body (3 main points with evidence), and memorable conclusion (call to action). Delivery elements: eye contact, vocal variety (pace, pitch, volume, pauses), gestures, and confident posture. In formal debate: state your claim, provide evidence (statistics, expert testimony, examples), address counterarguments (concede and refute), and conclude with impact. Logical fallacies to avoid: ad hominem (attacking the person), straw man (misrepresenting an argument), false dilemma (only two options), and appeal to popularity.",

MLA format: in-text citations (Author page) and a Works Cited page. APA format: in-text citations (Author, year) and a References page.
