            "explanation": "The theme is the underlying message or lesson that the author wants the reader to take away from a story. Theme is different from the topic. The topic is what the story is about (like 'friendship'), while the theme is the message about that topic (like 'true friends stand by you during difficult times'). A theme is usually a universal truth that applies to many people, not just the characters in the story. Authors rarely state the theme directly. Instead, you figure it out by thinking about what the characters learn, how the story ends, and how the events connect. Common themes include the importance of courage, kindness, honesty, perseverance, and accepting differences.",

A helpful framework is: Somebody (character) Wanted (goal) But (conflict) So (action) Then (resolution). For nonfiction, identify the main topic, find the author's main idea or argument, and list the key supporting points. Leave out specific data, quotes, and minor examples.

Unlike summarizing, which makes text shorter, paraphrasing is usually about the same length as the original. Paraphrasing shows that you truly understand what you read because you can express it differently. To paraphrase well, read the original carefully, look away from it, and then rewrite the idea in your own words. Check that your version has the same meaning but uses different words and sentence structure.

            "explanation": "Not all arguments are good arguments. Learning to evaluate arguments means checking if the evidence actually supports the claim and if the reasoning makes sense. A logical fallacy is a mistake in reasoning that makes an argument weak. Some common fallacies include: Ad hominem (attacking the person instead of the argument), Bandwagon ('Everyone is doing it, so it must be right'), Straw man (misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack), and Hasty generalization (making a broad conclusion from very little evidence). Being able to spot fallacies helps you think critically about what you read and hear, and helps you avoid making the same mistakes in your own arguments.",

              {"problem": "Identify the fallacy: 'You cannot trust his argument about healthy eating because he is overweight.'", "answer": "Ad hominem.", "explanation": "This attacks the person rather than addressing the evidence and reasoning in their argument."}
