            "explanation": "A ratio compares two quantities. You can write ratios three ways: using the word 'to' (3 to 4), using a colon (3:4), or as a fraction (3/4). Ratios describe part-to-part or part-to-whole relationships. For example, if there are 3 cats and 4 dogs, the ratio of cats to dogs is 3:4. The ratio of cats to total animals is 3:7. The order in a ratio matters: 3:4 is different from 4:3.",

You might need to determine which container holds more, or how many times one volume fits into another. Doubling one dimension doubles the volume; doubling all dimensions multiplies the volume by 8 (2³). Understanding how changes in dimensions affect volume is important for real-world applications.",
