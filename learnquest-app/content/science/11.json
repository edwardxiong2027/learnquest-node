            "explanation": "Kinematics is the branch of physics that describes how objects move without worrying about the forces causing the motion. To describe motion we need a reference point (origin) and a coordinate system. Position is where an object is located relative to the origin, measured in meters (m). Distance is the total length of the path traveled regardless of direction \u2014 it is always positive (a scalar). Displacement is the change in position from start to finish \u2014 it has both magnitude and direction (a vector). Displacement equals final position minus initial position: \u0394x = x_f \u2212 x_i. Two objects can travel the same distance but have very different displacements. For example, if you walk 5 m east and then 5 m west, your distance is 10 m but your displacement is 0 m because you ended where you started.",

Average velocity can be zero even when average speed is not, such as when an object returns to its starting point.

            "explanation": "Friction is a contact force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of motion between two surfaces. There are two main types: static friction prevents an object from starting to move, and kinetic (sliding) friction acts on an object that is already moving. The magnitude of friction depends on the normal force and the coefficient of friction: f = \u03bcN, where \u03bc is the coefficient of friction (a dimensionless number). Static friction can vary from zero up to a maximum value f_s,max = \u03bc_s \u00d7 N. Once the applied force exceeds f_s,max, the object starts moving and kinetic friction takes over: f_k = \u03bc_k \u00d7 N. Typically \u03bc_s > \u03bc_k, meaning it takes more force to start an object moving than to keep it moving. Friction depends on the nature of the surfaces and the normal force, not on the contact area.",

In a collision between two billiard balls, the total momentum before the collision equals the total momentum after the collision. Even if individual objects change speed or direction, the system's total momentum is conserved.

            "explanation": "An object moving in a circle at constant speed is undergoing uniform circular motion. Even though the speed is constant, the velocity is continuously changing direction, so the object is accelerating. This acceleration is called centripetal acceleration and it always points toward the center of the circle: a_c = v\u00b2/r, where v is the speed and r is the radius of the circle. The period T is the time for one complete revolution, and the speed can be expressed as v = 2\u03c0r/T. The frequency f is the number of revolutions per second: f = 1/T, measured in hertz (Hz). An object in circular motion constantly changes direction but not speed.",

            "explanation": "The Doppler effect is the change in observed frequency (and wavelength) of a wave when the source and observer are moving relative to each other. When a source approaches, the observer hears a higher pitch (higher frequency, shorter wavelength). When the source recedes, the observer hears a lower pitch (lower frequency, longer wavelength). For sound, the observed frequency is f' = f \u00d7 (v \u00b1 v_observer) / (v \u2213 v_source), where v is the speed of sound. The classic example is a siren changing pitch as an ambulance passes you. The Doppler effect applies to all waves, including light \u2014 astronomers use the redshift (light shifted to lower frequency) of distant galaxies to determine they are moving away from us, providing evidence for the expanding universe.",

A convex mirror diverges light, appearing to come from a virtual focal point behind the mirror (f negative). The mirror/lens equation is 1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i, where d_o is the object distance and d_i is the image distance. Magnification m = \u2212d_i/d_o = h_i/h_o. Converging (convex) lenses are thicker in the middle and focus parallel light to a point. Diverging (concave) lenses are thinner in the middle and spread light apart. Sign conventions: real images have positive d_i, virtual images have negative d_i. Magnification |m| > 1 means enlarged, |m| < 1 means reduced.",

Current (I) is the rate of flow of electric charge: I = Q/t, measured in amperes (A), where 1 A = 1 C/s. Conventional current flows from positive to negative terminal (opposite to electron flow). Voltage (V) is the electric potential difference \u2014 the energy per unit charge that drives current through a circuit. Resistance (R) opposes current flow, measured in ohms (\u03a9). Ohm's Law relates these: V = IR. A resistor with higher resistance allows less current for a given voltage. Power dissipated in a circuit element is P = IV = I\u00b2R = V\u00b2/R.",

You cannot isolate a single magnetic pole \u2014 cutting a magnet in half produces two smaller magnets, each with both poles. A magnetic field (B) surrounds every magnet, with field lines running from north to south outside the magnet. Moving electric charges create magnetic fields. A current-carrying wire produces a circular magnetic field around it (right-hand rule: thumb in direction of current, fingers curl in direction of magnetic field). An electromagnet is a coil of wire (solenoid) with current flowing through it, producing a strong magnetic field that can be turned on and off.
