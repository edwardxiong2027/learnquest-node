Think of it like a neighborhood where everyone depends on each other. In a pond ecosystem, fish eat insects, frogs eat flies, and plants make oxygen that the animals breathe. Every part of an ecosystem has an important job. If one part changes, it can affect everything else. For example, if all the plants in a pond died, the animals that eat plants would have no food, and the animals that eat those animals would also go hungry.",

Some animals depend on other animals. Birds called oxpeckers sit on the backs of buffalo and eat ticks and bugs off their skin. The oxpecker gets food, and the buffalo gets cleaned!

            "explanation": "Frogs also go through metamorphosis, but their life cycle is different from butterflies. A frog's life cycle has several stages. First, an adult frog lays eggs (called frogspawn) in water. The eggs are surrounded by a jelly-like substance that protects them. After about one to three weeks, tadpoles hatch from the eggs. Tadpoles look like small fish — they have tails, no legs, and breathe through gills underwater. Over several weeks, the tadpole begins to change. It grows back legs first, then front legs. Its tail gets shorter and shorter. Its gills are replaced by lungs so it can breathe air. Finally, the tadpole has fully transformed into a young frog (called a froglet) and can leave the water to live on land. The adult frog can live both in water and on land.",

This young plant is called a seedling. As the seedling gets water, nutrients from the soil, and sunlight, it grows into a mature plant with a strong stem, leaves, and roots. The mature plant produces flowers. Flowers contain special parts for reproduction: the stamen makes pollen, and the pistil contains ovules. When pollen reaches the pistil (through pollination by wind, insects, or animals), seeds form inside the flower. The seeds are often found inside fruit. When the seeds are spread to new places (by wind, animals, or water), they can germinate and grow into new plants, starting the cycle again.",

Unlike solids and liquids, gases have no definite shape AND no definite volume — they expand to fill their entire container. This is why the air in a room fills the whole room, and the air in a balloon fills the whole balloon. You cannot usually see gases, but you can often feel them (like wind) or smell them (like the smell of cookies baking). When you blow up a balloon, you are trapping gas (air) inside. The gas pushes against the walls of the balloon in all directions, which is why balloons are puffy. If you pop the balloon, the gas rushes out and spreads into the room.",

There are six types of simple machines: lever, inclined plane (ramp), wheel and axle, pulley, wedge, and screw. These six simple machines are the building blocks of all complex machines.

Other examples of wheel and axle include doorknobs, steering wheels, screwdrivers, and bicycle wheels. A pulley is a wheel with a groove around its edge and a rope or chain that fits in the groove. When you pull down on one end of the rope, the other end goes up. Pulleys are great for lifting heavy things.

A doorstop is a wedge that you push under a door to hold it open. A screw is actually an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder (like a pole). If you unwound the threads of a screw, they would form a ramp. Screws convert a turning force into a pushing or pulling force.

            "explanation": "Meteorologists use special tools to measure different parts of the weather. A thermometer measures temperature — how hot or cold the air is. Temperature is measured in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) or degrees Celsius (°C). A rain gauge collects and measures how much rain has fallen. It is basically a container with measurement marks on the side. An anemometer measures wind speed. It has small cups that spin when the wind blows — the faster they spin, the stronger the wind. A wind vane (also called a weather vane) shows the direction the wind is blowing from. A barometer measures air pressure — the weight of the air pushing down on us. Falling air pressure often means a storm is coming, while rising air pressure usually means fair weather. A hygrometer measures humidity (moisture in the air).",

            "explanation": "There are many different types of weather. Sunny weather means clear skies with lots of sunlight. Cloudy weather means the sky is covered with clouds, blocking some or all of the sun. Rainy weather brings precipitation as liquid water falling from clouds. Snowy weather occurs when temperatures are cold enough for precipitation to fall as snowflakes. Windy weather means the air is moving quickly — sometimes gently as a breeze, sometimes strongly as a gust. Foggy weather happens when clouds form very close to the ground, making it hard to see far. Stormy weather can include thunderstorms (with lightning, thunder, heavy rain, and sometimes hail), blizzards (heavy snow with strong winds), and tornadoes (violently spinning columns of air). Severe weather like hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards can be dangerous and people need to take shelter to stay safe.",

You can estimate how far away a storm is by counting seconds between lightning and thunder — about 5 seconds equals one mile."},
              {"problem": "What is a blizzard?", "answer": "A blizzard is a severe winter storm with heavy snowfall, strong winds (at least 35 mph), and low visibility that lasts at least three hours.", "explanation": "Blizzards can make it very dangerous to drive or be outside because you cannot see and the cold can cause frostbite."}

            "explanation": "While weather changes day to day, climate is the average pattern of weather in a region over a long period (usually 30 years or more). Different places on Earth have different climates. Tropical climates near the equator are hot and wet all year. Polar climates near the North and South Poles are cold all year. Temperate climates (like most of the United States) have four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. Seasons happen because Earth is tilted on its axis as it orbits the sun. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, it gets more direct sunlight and has summer. When it is tilted away from the sun, it gets less direct sunlight and has winter. Deserts have a hot, dry climate with very little rainfall. Rainforests have a warm, wet climate with lots of rain. The type of climate an area has determines what plants and animals can live there.",
