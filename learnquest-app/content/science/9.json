            "explanation": "The scientific method is a systematic process scientists use to investigate questions about the natural world. It begins with an observation \u2014 something you notice that sparks curiosity. From there, you form a hypothesis, which is a testable, educated guess that predicts an outcome. Next, you design and conduct an experiment to test your hypothesis. You collect and analyze data, then draw a conclusion about whether the data supports or refutes your hypothesis. Finally, you communicate your results so others can review and replicate your work. The scientific method is not always a rigid, linear sequence; scientists often revisit steps, refine hypotheses, and repeat experiments.",

The number of protons defines the element (for example, carbon always has 6 protons). Elements are pure substances made of only one type of atom, and they are organized on the periodic table. When two or more elements chemically bond together, they form a compound. For instance, water (H2O) is a compound made of hydrogen and oxygen. Chemical bonds form when atoms share electrons (covalent bonds) or transfer electrons (ionic bonds). About 25 elements are essential to life, with carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen (CHON) making up about 96% of living matter.",

            "explanation": "Water is essential to all known life, and its unique properties arise from its molecular structure. Water is a polar molecule \u2014 the oxygen end has a slight negative charge and the hydrogen end has a slight positive charge. This polarity allows water molecules to form hydrogen bonds with each other, giving water several life-supporting properties. Cohesion is the attraction between water molecules, which creates surface tension. Adhesion is the attraction between water and other substances, which allows water to travel up plant stems (capillary action). Water has a high specific heat capacity, meaning it resists temperature changes, helping organisms and environments maintain stable temperatures. Water is an excellent solvent \u2014 it dissolves more substances than any other common liquid, earning it the nickname 'universal solvent.' Uniquely, ice is less dense than liquid water, so it floats, insulating aquatic ecosystems in winter.",

Carbohydrates are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and serve as the body's primary energy source. The simplest carbohydrates are monosaccharides (single sugars) like glucose. Two monosaccharides joined together form a disaccharide, such as sucrose (table sugar). Many monosaccharides linked in long chains form polysaccharides like starch (energy storage in plants), glycogen (energy storage in animals), and cellulose (structural support in plant cell walls). Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, and steroids. They are mostly nonpolar and do not dissolve in water. Fats are made of glycerol and three fatty acid chains (triglycerides). Saturated fats have no double bonds between carbon atoms and are solid at room temperature (butter). Unsaturated fats have one or more double bonds and are liquid at room temperature (olive oil).

They are built from chains of amino acids \u2014 there are 20 different amino acids, and the sequence in which they are arranged determines the protein's shape and function. Amino acids are linked by peptide bonds. Proteins serve many functions: enzymes speed up chemical reactions, structural proteins (like collagen and keratin) provide support, antibodies defend against pathogens, and transport proteins (like hemoglobin) carry substances. A protein's function depends entirely on its 3D shape; if the shape is altered (denatured) by heat or pH changes, the protein loses its function. Nucleic acids \u2014 DNA and RNA \u2014 store and transmit genetic information. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double-stranded helix made of nucleotide monomers, each containing a sugar (deoxyribose), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine). RNA (ribonucleic acid) is single-stranded, uses ribose sugar, and has uracil instead of thymine. DNA stores the instructions for building proteins; RNA helps carry out those instructions.",

Organisms can be unicellular (made of one cell, like bacteria and amoebas) or multicellular (made of many cells, like humans and plants). Cells were first observed by Robert Hooke in 1665 when he looked at cork under a microscope and saw small, box-like compartments he named 'cells.' Anton van Leeuwenhoek later observed living cells, including bacteria and protists, using improved microscopes. There are two fundamental types of cells: prokaryotic cells (no nucleus, found in bacteria and archaea) and eukaryotic cells (have a membrane-bound nucleus, found in animals, plants, fungi, and protists).",

            "explanation": "The cell membrane (plasma membrane) is a thin, flexible barrier that surrounds every cell and controls what enters and exits. It is composed of a phospholipid bilayer \u2014 two layers of phospholipid molecules. Each phospholipid has a hydrophilic (water-loving) head and two hydrophobic (water-fearing) tails. The heads face the watery environments inside and outside the cell, while the tails face each other in the interior of the membrane. This arrangement is called the fluid mosaic model because the membrane is flexible and contains a mosaic of proteins embedded in or attached to it. Channel proteins and transport proteins allow specific substances to cross the membrane. The membrane is selectively permeable (semi-permeable), meaning it allows some substances to pass through while blocking others. Small, nonpolar molecules (like oxygen and carbon dioxide) can pass through freely, while large or charged molecules need help from transport proteins.",

Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Water moves from areas of lower solute concentration (hypotonic) to areas of higher solute concentration (hypertonic) until equilibrium is reached (isotonic). In a hypertonic solution, a cell loses water and shrivels (crenation in animal cells, plasmolysis in plant cells). In a hypotonic solution, a cell gains water and may swell or burst (lysis in animal cells; plant cells become turgid but are protected by their cell wall). Facilitated diffusion uses transport proteins to help larger molecules cross the membrane \u2014 still passive (no energy).

In words: six molecules of carbon dioxide plus six molecules of water, using light energy, produce one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen. Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages. The light-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes, where light energy splits water molecules, releasing oxygen and producing ATP and NADPH. The light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) take place in the stroma, where CO2 is fixed into glucose using the ATP and NADPH from the light reactions.

Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm: glucose (6 carbons) is split into two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons each), producing a small amount of ATP (net 2 ATP). The Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle) occurs in the mitochondrial matrix: pyruvate is further broken down, releasing CO2 and transferring energy to electron carriers (NADH and FADH2). The electron transport chain (ETC) occurs along the inner mitochondrial membrane: electrons from NADH and FADH2 pass through protein complexes, creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthase to produce most of the ATP (about 34 ATP). In total, one glucose molecule can yield up to 36-38 ATP molecules.",

            "explanation": "ATP (adenosine triphosphate) is the primary energy carrier in all living cells. It consists of adenine (a nitrogenous base), ribose (a 5-carbon sugar), and three phosphate groups. Energy is stored in the bonds between the phosphate groups, particularly the bond between the second and third phosphate. When ATP is used for energy, an enzyme breaks the terminal phosphate bond, releasing energy and producing ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and an inorganic phosphate (Pi). This reaction is: ATP -> ADP + Pi + energy. Cells constantly recycle ADP back into ATP through cellular respiration and photosynthesis. Your body uses and regenerates approximately its own body weight in ATP each day. ATP powers almost every cellular process: muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, active transport across membranes, protein synthesis, and cell division. ATP is not stored in large quantities \u2014 it is made on demand and used almost immediately.",

When oxygen is unavailable, cells can still produce a small amount of ATP through glycolysis, but the pyruvate produced cannot enter the Krebs cycle or electron transport chain. Instead, pyruvate is converted through fermentation to regenerate NAD+, which is needed to keep glycolysis running. There are two main types of fermentation. Lactic acid fermentation converts pyruvate into lactic acid. This occurs in your muscle cells during intense exercise when oxygen cannot be delivered fast enough. The buildup of lactic acid contributes to the burning sensation in overworked muscles. Some bacteria also perform lactic acid fermentation \u2014 this is how yogurt and cheese are made. Alcoholic fermentation converts pyruvate into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. Yeast performs this type of fermentation, which is used in baking (CO2 makes bread rise) and brewing. Fermentation is much less efficient than aerobic respiration, yielding only 2 ATP per glucose molecule compared to 36-38 from full cellular respiration.",

He studied inheritance by cross-pollinating pea plants and tracking traits across generations. Mendel chose pea plants because they have clearly contrasting traits (tall vs short, purple vs white flowers, round vs wrinkled seeds), reproduce quickly, and he could control pollination. Mendel discovered that traits are determined by discrete factors (now called genes) that come in pairs \u2014 one from each parent. His Law of Segregation states that the two alleles for a trait separate during gamete formation (meiosis), so each gamete carries only one allele. His Law of Independent Assortment states that alleles for different traits are inherited independently of each other (as long as they are on different chromosomes). Mendel's work was largely ignored during his lifetime but was rediscovered in 1900 and became the foundation of modern genetics.",

Its structure was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, with critical contributions from Rosalind Franklin's X-ray crystallography. DNA is a double helix \u2014 two long strands twisted around each other like a spiral staircase. Each strand is a chain of nucleotides. A nucleotide has three parts: a phosphate group, a deoxyribose sugar, and a nitrogenous base. There are four bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). The bases pair specifically: adenine always pairs with thymine (A-T) via two hydrogen bonds, and guanine always pairs with cytosine (G-C) via three hydrogen bonds. This is called complementary base pairing. The two strands run in opposite directions (antiparallel). The sugar-phosphate backbone forms the sides of the 'ladder,' and the base pairs form the 'rungs.' The sequence of bases along a DNA strand encodes genetic information \u2014 like letters forming words.",

Replication is semiconservative \u2014 each new DNA molecule contains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. The process begins when the enzyme helicase unwinds and separates the double helix at specific sites called origins of replication, forming a replication fork. Single-strand binding proteins keep the strands from re-pairing. The enzyme DNA polymerase then reads each template strand and adds complementary nucleotides (A with T, G with C), building a new strand in the 5' to 3' direction. The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized in short fragments called Okazaki fragments, which are later joined by DNA ligase. Proofreading enzymes check for errors \u2014 DNA polymerase has a built-in error-correction mechanism, making replication remarkably accurate with only about 1 error per billion nucleotides.",

Transcription occurs in the nucleus: the enzyme RNA polymerase binds to a gene's promoter region and reads the DNA template strand, building a complementary messenger RNA (mRNA) strand. In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine (T), so A pairs with U. The mRNA strand is then processed (introns are removed, exons are spliced together) and exits the nucleus through nuclear pores. Translation occurs at ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The ribosome reads the mRNA in sets of three bases called codons. Each codon specifies one amino acid. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry amino acids to the ribosome; each tRNA has an anticodon that pairs with a complementary mRNA codon. The amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain (protein). Translation begins at a start codon (AUG, which codes for methionine) and ends at a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA).",

Both insertions and deletions can cause a frameshift mutation, which shifts the reading frame of all subsequent codons, usually producing a nonfunctional protein. Chromosomal mutations involve large segments of chromosomes and include deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. Not all mutations are harmful \u2014 some are neutral, and some can be beneficial, providing variation for natural selection.",

Darwin noticed that finches on different islands had different beak shapes suited to the available food sources. Natural selection is the process by which organisms with traits better suited to their environment survive and reproduce more successfully than others. Four conditions are required for natural selection: (1) variation exists within a population, (2) some variations are heritable, (3) more offspring are produced than can survive (overproduction), and (4) individuals with favorable traits have higher fitness \u2014 they are more likely to survive and pass their genes to the next generation. Over many generations, natural selection leads to adaptation \u2014 the accumulation of traits that improve survival in a specific environment.

Behavioral adaptations involve actions: bird migration, hibernation, nocturnal hunting, or schooling behavior in fish. Physiological adaptations involve internal body processes: the ability of camels to conserve water, antifreeze proteins in Arctic fish blood, or venom production in snakes. Mimicry is a fascinating adaptation \u2014 some harmless organisms evolve to resemble harmful ones (Batesian mimicry), while some harmful organisms evolve to look alike (Mullerian mimicry).

The most common mechanism is allopatric speciation, which occurs when a physical barrier (mountain range, river, ocean) geographically separates a population. The separated groups can no longer interbreed, and they experience different environmental pressures and mutations. Over time, genetic differences accumulate until the groups can no longer produce fertile offspring even if reunited \u2014 they have become separate species. Sympatric speciation occurs without geographic separation, often through polyploidy (having extra sets of chromosomes, common in plants) or through ecological specialization within the same area. Reproductive isolation is the key to speciation \u2014 mechanisms that prevent two groups from interbreeding include temporal isolation (breeding at different times), behavioral isolation (different mating rituals), and mechanical isolation (incompatible reproductive structures).",

Producers (autotrophs) like plants and algae capture sunlight through photosynthesis and convert it to chemical energy. Primary consumers (herbivores) eat producers. Secondary consumers (carnivores or omnivores) eat primary consumers. Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. Decomposers (bacteria and fungi) break down dead organisms and recycle nutrients back into the soil. A food chain shows a single pathway of energy transfer: grass -> rabbit -> fox -> eagle. A food web is a network of interconnected food chains in an ecosystem, showing multiple feeding relationships. An energy pyramid shows that only about 10% of the energy at each trophic level is transferred to the next level. The rest is lost as heat through cellular respiration. This is the 10% rule: if producers capture 10,000 kcal, primary consumers get about 1,000 kcal, secondary consumers get about 100 kcal, and tertiary consumers get about 10 kcal. This is why top predators are rare and food chains rarely have more than 4-5 levels.",

A population's size is affected by four factors: birth rate, death rate, immigration (individuals moving in), and emigration (individuals moving out). Exponential growth occurs when a population has unlimited resources \u2014 it grows faster and faster, producing a J-shaped curve. However, no environment has unlimited resources. The carrying capacity (K) is the maximum population size an environment can sustain. As a population approaches carrying capacity, growth slows due to limiting factors (food, water, space, predation, disease), producing an S-shaped curve called logistic growth. Density-dependent limiting factors intensify as population density increases (competition, disease, predation). Density-independent limiting factors affect populations regardless of size (natural disasters, weather, human destruction of habitat). Populations can be described by their growth rate, age structure (proportion of individuals in each age group), and distribution pattern (clumped, uniform, or random).",

Habitat destruction through deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture is the leading cause of biodiversity loss. When habitats are fragmented, populations become isolated and more vulnerable to extinction. Pollution takes many forms: air pollution (greenhouse gases, smog), water pollution (industrial waste, agricultural runoff, plastics), and soil contamination. Climate change, driven primarily by the burning of fossil fuels that release greenhouse gases (CO2, methane), is causing rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, rising sea levels, and more extreme weather events. The greenhouse effect itself is natural and necessary for life \u2014 greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere \u2014 but human activities have intensified it. Overexploitation (overfishing, overhunting, overlogging) depletes resources faster than they can be replenished. Invasive species introduced to new environments can outcompete native species.
