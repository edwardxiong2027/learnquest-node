            "explanation": "An ecosystem includes all the living things (biotic factors) and nonliving things (abiotic factors) in an area and how they interact. Biotic factors are anything alive or once alive: plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and even dead leaves on the ground. Abiotic factors are nonliving parts of the environment: sunlight, temperature, water, air, soil, and minerals. Every ecosystem has both, and they work together. For example, plants (biotic) need sunlight and water (abiotic) to grow. Fish (biotic) need clean water at the right temperature (abiotic) to survive. A habitat is the specific place where an organism lives and finds food, water, shelter, and space. A niche is the role an organism plays in its ecosystem \u2014 what it eats, what eats it, and how it interacts with other organisms. No two species in the same ecosystem can have exactly the same niche for long, because they would compete until one wins out.",

            "explanation": "In every ecosystem, energy flows from the sun to producers, then to consumers at different levels. A food web shows all the feeding relationships in an ecosystem. Unlike a simple food chain, a food web has many overlapping paths. Energy enters the ecosystem when producers like plants and algae use photosynthesis to convert sunlight into chemical energy stored in glucose. Primary consumers (herbivores) eat the producers and get some of that energy. Secondary consumers (carnivores or omnivores) eat the primary consumers. Tertiary consumers eat the secondary consumers. At each level, only about 10 percent of the energy is passed on to the next level. The rest is used by the organism for life processes like moving, breathing, and keeping warm, or is lost as heat. This is called the 10 percent rule. Because of this energy loss, food webs can only support a few levels of consumers.",

These nutrients \u2014 nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon, and others \u2014 return to the soil, water, and air. Producers then absorb these nutrients and use them to grow, starting the cycle again.

Commensalism is when one organism benefits and the other is neither helped nor harmed. For example, a remora fish attaches to a shark and eats leftover scraps \u2014 the remora benefits, and the shark is not affected. Parasitism is when one organism benefits and the other is harmed. For example, a tick attaches to a dog and feeds on its blood. The tick benefits, but the dog is harmed. Understanding these relationships helps us see how deeply connected all living things are.",

Color, shape, size, texture, and odor are physical properties you can observe with your senses. Other physical properties can be measured. Density is how much mass is packed into a certain volume, calculated by dividing mass by volume (density = mass / volume). An object with high density has a lot of mass packed into a small space, like a rock. An object with low density has less mass spread over more space, like a sponge. Objects denser than water sink; objects less dense than water float. Boiling point is the temperature at which a liquid becomes a gas. Melting point is the temperature at which a solid becomes a liquid. These are all physical properties because measuring them does not change what the substance is.",

            "explanation": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below Earth's surface. It is powered by energy from the sun. Evaporation occurs when the sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers, turning liquid water into water vapor (gas) that rises into the atmosphere. Transpiration is when plants release water vapor through their leaves. Condensation happens when water vapor cools as it rises and forms tiny water droplets that cling to dust particles, creating clouds. Precipitation occurs when water droplets in clouds combine and become heavy enough to fall as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Collection happens when water that falls collects in oceans, lakes, rivers, and underground (groundwater). Then the cycle starts again! The total amount of water on Earth never changes \u2014 it just keeps cycling between liquid, solid (ice), and gas (water vapor).",

The atmosphere is the layer of gases surrounding Earth, and weather happens in the lowest layer called the troposphere. Temperature is how hot or cold the air is, measured with a thermometer. Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. Air pressure (also called barometric pressure) is the weight of the atmosphere pressing down. High pressure usually brings clear, sunny weather. Low pressure often brings clouds and rain. Wind is caused by differences in air pressure \u2014 air moves from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas. Weather changes constantly because the sun heats Earth's surface unevenly. Land heats up faster than water, causing air pressure differences that drive weather patterns.",

These storms produce lightning (a giant spark of electricity), thunder (the sound caused by lightning heating the air), heavy rain, and sometimes hail. A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. Tornadoes are measured using the Enhanced Fujita Scale (EF0 to EF5) and are most common in the central United States, called Tornado Alley. A hurricane is a massive rotating storm that forms over warm ocean water. Hurricanes have an eye (calm center), an eye wall (strongest winds), and rain bands (outer rings). They are measured using the Saffir-Simpson Scale (Category 1 to 5). Blizzards are severe winter storms with heavy snow, strong winds, and cold temperatures.",

Water erosion happens when rain, rivers, and ocean waves break down rock and carry sediment (tiny pieces of rock and soil) to new locations. Deposition is when sediment is dropped in a new location. Fast-moving water can carry larger particles, but as water slows down, it drops the heaviest particles first. Rivers carve valleys and canyons over thousands of years. The Grand Canyon was carved by the Colorado River over millions of years! At river mouths, sediment is deposited to form deltas \u2014 fan-shaped areas of new land. Ocean waves erode coastlines, creating sea cliffs, caves, and arches. Glaciers carve U-shaped valleys as they move. Underground water dissolves limestone to create caves and sinkholes.",

The sun is at the center and contains over 99% of the mass in our solar system. The eight planets in order from the sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. A helpful way to remember the order is: My Very Excited Mother Just Served Us Nachos. The four inner planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars) are called terrestrial planets because they are small, rocky, and have solid surfaces. The four outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) are called gas giants (or ice giants for Uranus and Neptune) because they are much larger and made mostly of gases and liquids. Between Mars and Jupiter is the asteroid belt, a region with millions of rocky objects. Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006.",

Venus is similar in size to Earth but has a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide that traps heat, making it the hottest planet (about 900 degrees F). Venus spins backward compared to most planets. Earth is the third planet and the only one known to have liquid water on its surface and life. Our atmosphere of nitrogen and oxygen protects us and keeps temperatures comfortable.

Our sun is a medium-sized star called a yellow dwarf. Stars come in different sizes, colors, and temperatures. Blue stars are the hottest, followed by white, yellow (like our sun), orange, and red stars (the coolest). Stars have life cycles. They are born in nebulae \u2014 huge clouds of gas and dust in space. Gravity pulls the gas together until it gets hot enough to start nuclear fusion, and a star is born. A star like our sun will shine for about 10 billion years, then swell into a red giant, shed its outer layers, and end as a white dwarf. More massive stars can explode in a supernova and collapse into a neutron star or even a black hole. The elements that make up your body were created inside stars that exploded long ago!",

An orbit is the curved path one object takes around another due to gravity. The planets orbit the sun in slightly oval-shaped (elliptical) paths. Earth takes 365.25 days (one year) to orbit the sun. The moon takes about 27.3 days to orbit Earth. Earth also rotates (spins) on its axis once every 24 hours, giving us day and night. Earth's axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees, which causes the seasons. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, it experiences summer. When it is tilted away, it experiences winter.

Isaac Newton described three laws of motion. The first law (law of inertia) states that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion at the same speed and direction, unless acted on by an unbalanced force. This means a ball will not roll unless you push it, and it will keep rolling until friction or another force stops it. The second law states that the more force you apply to an object, the more it accelerates (speeds up). Also, heavier objects need more force to move. Force equals mass times acceleration (F = m x a). The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When you push against a wall, the wall pushes back on you with the same force. When a rocket pushes gas downward, the gas pushes the rocket upward.",

A lever is a bar that pivots on a fixed point called a fulcrum \u2014 like a seesaw, crowbar, or bottle opener. An inclined plane is a flat surface tilted at an angle, like a ramp. It takes less force to push something up a ramp than to lift it straight up, but you move it a longer distance. A wedge is two inclined planes put together to form a point, like an axe, knife, or doorstop. It splits or separates materials. A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder \u2014 like a wood screw, jar lid, or spiral staircase. A wheel and axle is a wheel attached to a rod (axle) \u2014 like a doorknob, bicycle wheel, or screwdriver. A pulley is a wheel with a rope around it that changes the direction of force \u2014 like a flagpole pulley or a crane. Compound machines combine two or more simple machines, like scissors (lever + wedge) or a bicycle (wheel and axle + lever + pulley).",

Step 1: Define the Problem \u2014 clearly identify what problem you are trying to solve and what constraints (limits) you have, like budget, materials, or time. Step 2: Research \u2014 learn about the problem and find out what solutions already exist. Step 3: Brainstorm \u2014 come up with as many ideas as possible without judging them. The more ideas the better! Step 4: Choose a Solution \u2014 evaluate your ideas and pick the best one based on your constraints. Step 5: Build a Prototype \u2014 create a simple, testable version of your design. Step 6: Test and Evaluate \u2014 test your prototype and collect data on how well it works. Did it solve the problem? Step 7: Improve \u2014 use your test results to make your design better. Then test again! This process is not always linear \u2014 engineers often go back to earlier steps as they learn more. This repeating cycle of testing and improving is called iteration.",

For example, if you are testing which bridge design can hold the most weight, you should use the same materials, the same size, and the same testing method for each design \u2014 only the shape should be different. Engineers collect data during tests by measuring and recording results carefully. They might measure how much weight a structure holds, how far a vehicle travels, how fast a process works, or how much energy a device uses. After collecting data, engineers analyze the results to find patterns and determine if the design meets the requirements. If it does not, they identify what needs to change and redesign. This cycle of build-test-analyze-improve is repeated until the design works well. Failure is not bad in engineering \u2014 each failure teaches you something valuable about how to make the design better.",
