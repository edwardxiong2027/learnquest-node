            "explanation": "The cell cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and replication. It consists of three main phases: interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis. Interphase is the longest phase, taking up about 90% of the cell cycle. During interphase, the cell grows, carries out its normal functions, and prepares for division. Interphase itself has three sub-phases: G1 (cell growth and normal activity), S phase (DNA synthesis — the cell copies all its DNA), and G2 (preparation for mitosis — the cell makes proteins and organelles needed for division). After interphase, the cell enters mitosis, during which the nucleus divides and the replicated DNA is separated into two identical sets. Finally, cytokinesis divides the cytoplasm, producing two identical daughter cells. The cell cycle is tightly regulated by checkpoints that ensure the cell is ready for the next stage. Errors in cell cycle regulation can lead to uncontrolled cell division — this is what causes cancer. Cancer cells ignore the normal checkpoints and keep dividing.",

            "explanation": "Mitosis is the process by which a cell's nucleus divides to produce two genetically identical nuclei. It has four stages: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase (remember PMAT). During prophase, the chromatin (loosely coiled DNA) condenses into visible chromosomes. Each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids joined at a point called the centromere. The nuclear membrane begins to break down, and spindle fibers form from the centrioles. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up in the middle (metaphase plate) of the cell, attached to spindle fibers at their centromeres. This is sometimes remembered as 'Middle = Metaphase.' During anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite ends of the cell by the spindle fibers. The centromeres split and each chromatid is now considered an individual chromosome. During telophase, a new nuclear membrane forms around each set of chromosomes, the chromosomes begin to uncoil, and the spindle fibers break down. After telophase, cytokinesis completes the division. In animal cells, the membrane pinches inward (cleavage furrow). In plant cells, a cell plate forms down the middle.",

This process is called DNA replication and occurs during the S phase of interphase. DNA replication follows several steps. First, the enzyme helicase unwinds and separates the two strands of the DNA double helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs, creating a replication fork that looks like a zipper being unzipped. Each separated strand then serves as a template for building a new complementary strand. The enzyme DNA polymerase reads the template strand and adds the correct complementary nucleotides one by one: A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. Because each new DNA molecule consists of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand, the process is called semiconservative replication. The result is two identical DNA molecules, each containing one old strand and one new strand. DNA replication is remarkably accurate, but errors (mutations) occasionally occur. Cells have proofreading enzymes that catch and correct most errors, but some slip through — about 1 error per billion base pairs copied.",

The process of converting DNA instructions into proteins is called protein synthesis, and it occurs in two main steps: transcription and translation. During transcription, which takes place in the nucleus, the DNA code is copied into a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule. RNA is similar to DNA but is single-stranded, uses the sugar ribose instead of deoxyribose, and uses uracil (U) instead of thymine (T). The enzyme RNA polymerase reads the DNA template strand and builds the mRNA strand using complementary base pairing: A pairs with U (in RNA), T pairs with A, G pairs with C, C pairs with G. The mRNA then leaves the nucleus and travels to a ribosome in the cytoplasm. During translation, the ribosome reads the mRNA code in groups of three bases called codons. Each codon specifies one amino acid. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carry amino acids to the ribosome and match their anticodon to the mRNA codon. The amino acids are linked together in a chain to form a protein. The sequence of codons in the mRNA determines the sequence of amino acids, which determines the shape and function of the protein.",

The key difference is that meiosis produces four genetically unique cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Human body cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs) — this is the diploid number (2n). Gametes have only 23 chromosomes — the haploid number (n). When a sperm (n=23) fertilizes an egg (n=23), the resulting zygote has the full diploid number (2n=46). Meiosis involves two rounds of division: meiosis I and meiosis II. During meiosis I, homologous chromosomes (matching pairs) are separated. This is when crossing over occurs — homologous chromosomes exchange segments of DNA, creating new combinations of alleles. During meiosis II, sister chromatids are separated (similar to mitosis). The result is four haploid daughter cells, each genetically unique due to crossing over and the random assortment of chromosomes. This genetic variation is essential for evolution by natural selection.",

It consists of two main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) — made up of the brain and spinal cord — and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) — all the nerves that branch out from the CNS to the rest of the body. The brain is the control center, divided into regions with different functions: the cerebrum handles thinking, memory, and voluntary movements; the cerebellum coordinates balance and coordination; and the brain stem controls involuntary functions like breathing, heartbeat, and digestion. The spinal cord is a bundle of nerves that carries signals between the brain and the body. The basic unit of the nervous system is the neuron (nerve cell). Neurons transmit electrical signals called nerve impulses. A neuron has three main parts: the cell body (contains the nucleus), dendrites (receive signals from other neurons), and the axon (sends signals to other neurons or muscles). Signals pass from one neuron to the next across a tiny gap called a synapse, using chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.",

Hormones travel through the bloodstream to target cells throughout the body, regulating growth, metabolism, reproduction, mood, and many other functions. Unlike the nervous system, which sends fast electrical signals, the endocrine system works more slowly but has longer-lasting effects. Key glands include: the pituitary gland (the 'master gland' in the brain that controls other glands and produces growth hormone), the thyroid (in the neck, regulates metabolism and energy with thyroid hormones), the adrenal glands (on top of the kidneys, produce adrenaline for the 'fight or flight' response and cortisol for stress), the pancreas (produces insulin to regulate blood sugar), and the reproductive glands — ovaries in females (produce estrogen) and testes in males (produce testosterone). Hormones work like a lock and key — each hormone fits only specific receptors on target cells. Feedback loops regulate hormone levels: when a hormone level gets too high, the body reduces production; when it gets too low, production increases. This is called negative feedback and is similar to how a thermostat works.",

The first line consists of physical and chemical barriers: skin blocks pathogens from entering, mucus in your nose and throat traps germs, stomach acid kills many bacteria, and tears contain enzymes that destroy bacteria. The second line of defense is the inflammatory response. When pathogens break through barriers, the body responds with inflammation — increased blood flow brings white blood cells to the area, causing redness, swelling, and warmth. Fever is also part of this response, as higher body temperature helps fight infection. The third line is the adaptive immune system, which targets specific pathogens. White blood cells called B cells produce antibodies — proteins shaped to lock onto specific antigens (molecules on the pathogen's surface). Once the body has fought a pathogen, memory cells 'remember' it so the response is faster next time. This is called immunity. Vaccines work by introducing weakened or inactive pathogens (or parts of them) to trigger antibody production without causing disease, creating immunity.",

            "explanation": "The nervous and endocrine systems work together to maintain homeostasis — the body's stable internal environment. The hypothalamus, a small region of the brain, is the key link between the two systems. It receives information from the nervous system about conditions inside and outside the body, and it controls the pituitary gland, which regulates most other endocrine glands. For example, when you're stressed, the hypothalamus signals the pituitary, which signals the adrenal glands to release cortisol and adrenaline. When you're cold, the hypothalamus detects the temperature drop (via the nervous system), triggers shivering (nervous system), and can also adjust your thyroid hormones to increase heat production (endocrine system). Blood sugar regulation is another example: after eating, the nervous system detects rising blood sugar and the pancreas releases insulin (endocrine). If blood sugar drops too low, the pancreas releases glucagon, which signals the liver to release stored glucose. The two systems complement each other: the nervous system provides fast, short-term responses, while the endocrine system provides slower, longer-lasting regulation.",

To balance an equation, you adjust the coefficients (the numbers in front of the chemical formulas), NOT the subscripts within the formulas. Changing subscripts would change the substance itself. Here is a systematic approach: (1) Write the unbalanced equation. (2) Count the atoms of each element on both sides. (3) Start balancing with the most complex molecule or the element that appears in only one reactant and one product. (4) Add coefficients to balance atoms one element at a time. (5) Check that all elements are balanced and coefficients are in the lowest whole-number ratio. For example, to balance: H2 + O2 → H2O. Count: Left has 2H and 2O; Right has 2H and 1O. Oxygen is unbalanced, so put a 2 in front of H2O: H2 + O2 → 2H2O. Now: Left has 2H and 2O; Right has 4H and 2O. Hydrogen is unbalanced, so put a 2 in front of H2: 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O.

            "explanation": "The reaction rate is how fast reactants are converted into products in a chemical reaction. Some reactions are very fast (like an explosion), while others are very slow (like iron rusting). Several factors affect reaction rate. Temperature: increasing temperature increases reaction rate because particles move faster and collide more often with more energy. Concentration: increasing the concentration of reactants (more particles in the same space) means more frequent collisions. Surface area: breaking a solid into smaller pieces exposes more surface to react — a powder reacts faster than a solid chunk. A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a reaction without being consumed in the reaction. It works by lowering the activation energy — the minimum energy needed for a reaction to start. Enzymes are biological catalysts found in living things. Your body uses thousands of different enzymes to speed up chemical reactions necessary for life. For example, the enzyme amylase in your saliva speeds up the breakdown of starch into sugars. Without enzymes, most biological reactions would be too slow to sustain life. An inhibitor is the opposite of a catalyst — it slows down or stops a reaction.",

Common acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), citric acid (in citrus fruits), and acetic acid (in vinegar). Bases are substances that produce hydroxide ions (OH-) when dissolved in water. They feel slippery, taste bitter, turn red litmus paper blue, and have a pH above 7. Common bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH — lye), ammonia, and baking soda. The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a substance is, ranging from 0 to 14. A pH of 7 is neutral (like pure water). Below 7 is acidic (lower number = stronger acid), and above 7 is basic/alkaline (higher number = stronger base). The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning each whole number change represents a 10-fold change in acidity. For example, a pH of 3 is 10 times more acidic than a pH of 4. When an acid and a base are mixed in the right proportions, they undergo a neutralization reaction, producing water and a salt: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O.",

The products have less energy than the reactants, and the surroundings get warmer. Examples include combustion (burning), cellular respiration, and mixing certain chemicals that feel hot. In an endothermic reaction, energy is absorbed from the surroundings. The products have more energy than the reactants, and the surroundings get cooler. Examples include photosynthesis (plants absorb light energy), melting ice, dissolving ammonium nitrate in water (used in instant cold packs), and cooking (food absorbs heat). Energy diagrams show the energy levels of reactants and products. In an exothermic reaction, the products are lower on the diagram than the reactants (energy was released). In an endothermic reaction, the products are higher (energy was absorbed). Both types of reactions require activation energy to get started — think of it as the energy 'push' needed to start the reaction, like the spark needed to light a fire. Exothermic reactions then release more energy than was needed to start them.",

When you drop a stone in water, ripples spread outward — the water moves up and down, but it doesn't travel with the wave. Waves have several key properties. Amplitude is the height of the wave from the rest position to the crest (top) or trough (bottom). Larger amplitude means more energy. Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive crests or two consecutive troughs. Frequency is the number of complete waves that pass a point per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). One Hz means one wave per second. Wave speed is how fast the wave travels, calculated by: Speed = Wavelength x Frequency. There are two main types of waves: transverse waves, where particles move perpendicular (up and down) to the wave direction (like a wave in a rope), and longitudinal waves, where particles move parallel (back and forth) to the wave direction (like a slinky being pushed and pulled). Sound is a longitudinal wave. Light is a transverse wave.",

When an object vibrates (like a guitar string or your vocal cords), it pushes and pulls on the air molecules around it, creating alternating areas of compression (where molecules are squeezed together) and rarefaction (where molecules are spread apart). These compressions and rarefactions travel outward from the source as a sound wave. Sound requires a medium (matter) to travel through — it cannot travel through a vacuum (empty space). That's why there is no sound in outer space. Sound travels fastest through solids (about 5,000 m/s in steel), slower through liquids (about 1,500 m/s in water), and slowest through gases (about 343 m/s in air at room temperature). The pitch of a sound is determined by its frequency — higher frequency means higher pitch. The loudness (volume) is determined by amplitude — larger amplitude means louder sound. Loudness is measured in decibels (dB). Normal conversation is about 60 dB, while sounds above 85 dB can cause hearing damage with prolonged exposure. The Doppler effect occurs when a sound source moves relative to the observer — the pitch seems higher as the source approaches and lower as it moves away.",

From longest wavelength (lowest frequency, lowest energy) to shortest wavelength (highest frequency, highest energy): radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. Visible light is the small portion of the EM spectrum that human eyes can detect. Within visible light, red has the longest wavelength and violet has the shortest. When all visible wavelengths combine, we see white light. A prism separates white light into its component colors (ROYGBIV: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).

            "explanation": "When a wave encounters a boundary or new medium, three things can happen: reflection, refraction, or absorption. Reflection occurs when a wave bounces off a surface. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence (incoming wave) equals the angle of reflection (outgoing wave). Smooth surfaces like mirrors produce regular reflection (clear images), while rough surfaces cause diffuse reflection (scattered light, no clear image). Refraction is the bending of a wave as it passes from one medium to another at an angle. This happens because waves travel at different speeds in different materials. Light slows down when it enters a denser medium (like glass or water), causing it to bend toward the normal line (perpendicular to the surface). This is why a straw in a glass of water appears bent — the light refracts as it passes from water to air. Lenses use refraction to focus or spread light: convex lenses (thicker in the middle) converge light and are used in magnifying glasses and telescopes; concave lenses (thinner in the middle) diverge light and are used to correct nearsightedness. Absorption occurs when a wave's energy is taken in by the material. Dark colors absorb more light energy (converting it to heat), which is why black clothes feel hotter in sunlight than white clothes.",

In the core of a star, extreme pressure and temperature cause hydrogen atoms to fuse into helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy as light and heat. A star's life cycle depends on its mass. All stars begin as a nebula — a cloud of gas and dust. Gravity causes the nebula to collapse, forming a protostar. When the core becomes hot enough for fusion to begin, a main sequence star is born. Our Sun is a main sequence star. Stars spend most of their lives in this stage. When a medium-sized star (like the Sun) runs out of hydrogen fuel, it expands into a red giant, then sheds its outer layers to form a planetary nebula, leaving behind a white dwarf that slowly cools. Massive stars (much larger than the Sun) expand into red supergiants, then explode in a spectacular supernova. What remains is either a neutron star (an incredibly dense remnant) or, if the star was massive enough, a black hole — a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.",

The Space Age began in 1957 when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first artificial satellite. In 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space. The United States' Apollo program achieved the most famous milestone: on July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the Moon during Apollo 11. Robotic exploration has expanded our knowledge enormously. Mars rovers like Spirit, Opportunity, Curiosity, and Perseverance have studied the Martian surface for signs of past water and life. The Voyager probes have explored the outer planets and entered interstellar space. The Hubble Space Telescope (launched 1990) and James Webb Space Telescope (launched 2021) have revolutionized our understanding of the universe. The International Space Station (ISS), continuously occupied since 2000, serves as a laboratory for research in microgravity. Current goals include returning humans to the Moon through NASA's Artemis program, sending humans to Mars, and searching for signs of life beyond Earth. Private companies like SpaceX are also advancing space technology with reusable rockets.",

While it's often presented as a step-by-step process, real science is more flexible and iterative. The general steps are: (1) Observation — notice something interesting or puzzling. (2) Question — ask a specific, testable question about the observation. (3) Research — gather background information about the topic. (4) Hypothesis — make a testable prediction that answers your question. A good hypothesis is specific and can be proven wrong (falsifiable). It's often written in 'If... then...' format: 'If plants are given more light, then they will grow taller.' (5) Experiment — design and conduct a controlled experiment to test the hypothesis. (6) Collect and Analyze Data — record observations and measurements, then look for patterns. (7) Conclusion — determine whether the data support or refute the hypothesis. (8) Communicate — share your findings with others so they can evaluate and replicate your work. If the data don't support the hypothesis, that's not failure — it's information! Scientists revise their hypothesis and test again. Science progresses through repeated cycles of testing and revision.",

All other conditions that are kept the same are called controlled variables (or constants). A control group is a group that doesn't receive the experimental treatment — it serves as a baseline for comparison. For example, if testing whether fertilizer affects plant growth: the independent variable is the amount of fertilizer (what you change), the dependent variable is plant height (what you measure), controlled variables include the amount of water, sunlight, soil type, and pot size (kept the same), and the control group is plants that receive no fertilizer. Sample size matters — testing more subjects gives more reliable results. If you only test one plant with fertilizer and one without, the results could be due to chance. Testing 20 plants in each group gives much more reliable data.

Common ways to represent data include: data tables (organize raw numbers), bar graphs (compare categories), line graphs (show changes over time or continuous relationships), pie charts (show parts of a whole), and scatter plots (show relationships between two variables). When analyzing data, scientists calculate measures of central tendency: the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value).

            "explanation": "Being a good scientist means thinking critically about evidence, claims, and conclusions. Correlation does not imply causation — just because two things happen together doesn't mean one causes the other. For example, ice cream sales and drowning rates both increase in summer, but ice cream doesn't cause drowning (both are caused by hot weather). Bias can affect scientific results. Confirmation bias is the tendency to notice evidence that supports what you already believe and ignore evidence that contradicts it. This is why experiments should be designed with controls and, when possible, blinding (where researchers don't know which group is experimental or control). When evaluating scientific claims, consider: Is the claim based on evidence from controlled experiments? Has the research been peer-reviewed (evaluated by other scientists)? Can the results be replicated by independent researchers? Is the sample size large enough? Are there conflicts of interest (like a company funding research on its own product)? Science is self-correcting — when mistakes are made, other scientists eventually discover them through replication and peer review. The strength of science comes from this community process of checking each other's work.",
