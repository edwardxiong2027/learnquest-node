Liquids flow and take the shape of their container, like water or juice. Gases spread out to fill all the space they can, like the air around us. Each state of matter behaves differently because of how tiny particles inside are moving. In solids, particles are packed tightly. In liquids, they slide around. In gases, they fly all over!",
