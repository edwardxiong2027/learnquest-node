            "explanation": "All living things need energy to survive, grow, and reproduce. In every ecosystem, energy flows from one organism to another. The original source of energy for almost all ecosystems on Earth is the sun. Plants and algae capture the sun's energy through photosynthesis — the process of using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make glucose (sugar) for food, while releasing oxygen. Because plants make their own food, they are called producers. Animals cannot make their own food, so they must eat other organisms to get energy. Animals are called consumers. When animals eat food, they use most of the energy for moving, growing, and staying warm. Only about 10% of the energy is passed on to the next animal in the food chain. This means that energy decreases as it moves through the ecosystem, which is why there are always more producers than top predators.",

              {"problem": "Why are there more mice than eagles in a grassland ecosystem?", "answer": "Energy decreases at each level of the food chain. It takes many plants to feed the mice, and many mice to feed just one eagle. There must be more organisms at the bottom than at the top.", "explanation": "Only about 10% of energy passes from one level to the next. So it takes a LOT of producers to support just a few top predators."},
              {"problem": "What is photosynthesis?", "answer": "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (food energy) and oxygen.", "explanation": "The word 'photosynthesis' comes from 'photo' (light) and 'synthesis' (putting together).

            "explanation": "A food chain shows a single path of energy from one organism to the next. Every food chain starts with a producer (a plant or algae), followed by a primary consumer (herbivore that eats plants), then a secondary consumer (carnivore that eats the herbivore), and sometimes a tertiary consumer (a carnivore that eats other carnivores). Decomposers break down dead organisms at every level and return nutrients to the soil. An energy pyramid is a diagram that shows how energy flows through a food chain. The bottom level (producers) has the most energy and the most organisms. Each higher level has less energy and fewer organisms. The pyramid shape shows us why ecosystems need many producers to support fewer herbivores, and even fewer carnivores at the top. Organisms at the top of the food chain, like eagles, wolves, and sharks, are called apex predators because no other animal hunts them.",

When we connect all the food chains in an ecosystem together, we get a food web. A food web shows the complex feeding relationships between all the organisms in an ecosystem. Food webs are like many food chains woven together. They give us a more complete and realistic picture of how energy flows through an ecosystem. In a food web, most animals are part of multiple food chains. For example, a mouse might be eaten by a snake, a hawk, an owl, or a fox. This interconnection makes ecosystems more stable — if one food source disappears, animals can often switch to other food sources. However, if a key species disappears, it can still cause problems throughout the entire food web.",

            "explanation": "Every organism in an ecosystem plays one of three roles: producer, consumer, or decomposer. Producers make their own food using energy from the sun. On land, producers include trees, grass, flowers, and bushes. In water, producers include algae and phytoplankton. Consumers must eat other organisms to get energy. There are three types: herbivores eat only plants (like deer, rabbits, and caterpillars), carnivores eat only animals (like lions, hawks, and sharks), and omnivores eat both plants and animals (like bears, humans, and raccoons). Decomposers break down dead plants and animals into simpler substances, returning nutrients to the soil so producers can use them again. Bacteria, fungi (like mushrooms and mold), and some insects (like beetles) are decomposers. Without decomposers, dead organisms would pile up and nutrients would be trapped, eventually causing producers to run out of the nutrients they need to grow.",

When something disrupts this balance, it can affect the entire ecosystem. Natural disruptions include wildfires, droughts, floods, and disease outbreaks. Human-caused disruptions include pollution, habitat destruction, introduction of invasive species, and overhunting. An invasive species is an organism introduced to an area where it does not naturally belong. Without natural predators to control its population, an invasive species can multiply rapidly and outcompete native species for food and habitat. For example, when rabbits were introduced to Australia, they had no natural predators and their population exploded, destroying crops and native vegetation. Ecosystems can sometimes recover from disruptions if the damage is not too severe and if they have enough biodiversity (variety of species).",

            "explanation": "Igneous rocks form when hot, melted rock material cools and hardens. Deep inside the Earth, temperatures are so hot that rock melts into a liquid called magma. When magma reaches Earth's surface through a volcano, it is called lava. As the melted rock cools, the minerals inside it form crystals and harden into igneous rock. There are two types of igneous rocks. Intrusive igneous rocks form when magma cools slowly underground. Because they cool slowly, the mineral crystals have time to grow large, making the rock look grainy or speckled. Granite is a common intrusive igneous rock with visible crystals. Extrusive igneous rocks form when lava cools quickly on Earth's surface. Because they cool fast, the crystals do not have time to grow large, so the rock looks smooth or glassy. Basalt and obsidian are common extrusive igneous rocks.",

Here is how it works: wind, water, and ice break existing rocks into smaller pieces through a process called weathering. These small pieces, called sediments, are carried by wind, water, or ice to new locations — this is erosion. The sediments settle in layers, often at the bottom of lakes, rivers, or oceans — this is deposition. Over thousands to millions of years, the weight of the layers above presses down on the lower layers (compaction), and minerals dissolved in water cement the particles together (cementation). This is how sedimentary rock forms. Sedimentary rocks often have visible layers and may contain fossils — the preserved remains of ancient living things. Common sedimentary rocks include sandstone (made of sand grains), limestone (often made of shells and sea creature remains), and shale (made of clay and mud).",

Deep inside Earth, rocks can be subjected to intense heat from nearby magma and enormous pressure from the weight of rock above them. These conditions cause the minerals in the rock to rearrange and form new crystals, changing the rock's texture and sometimes its mineral composition. Any type of rock — igneous, sedimentary, or even another metamorphic rock — can be transformed into a metamorphic rock. For example, limestone (a sedimentary rock) becomes marble when subjected to heat and pressure. Shale (sedimentary) becomes slate. Granite (igneous) becomes gneiss.

            "explanation": "The rock cycle is the continuous process by which rocks change from one type to another over millions of years. No rock stays the same forever — all rocks are slowly being changed by natural processes. Here is how it works: igneous rocks on the surface are broken down by weathering and erosion into sediments. These sediments are deposited in layers and eventually become sedimentary rocks through compaction and cementation. When sedimentary rocks are pushed deep underground by plate movements, heat and pressure transform them into metamorphic rocks. If metamorphic rocks are pushed even deeper where temperatures are extreme, they can melt into magma. When magma cools, it forms new igneous rocks, and the cycle continues. However, the cycle does not always follow this exact order. Any rock type can be transformed into any other rock type. For example, igneous rock can be pushed underground and become metamorphic without first becoming sedimentary.",

Chemical weathering changes the chemical composition of rocks.

Wind picks up sand and dust and carries it across deserts, forming sand dunes. Glaciers (massive sheets of ice) slowly move across the land, scraping up rock and soil and carrying it along. Gravity causes rockslides and landslides, pulling loose material downhill. When the eroding agent (water, wind, ice, or gravity) loses energy, it drops the sediment it was carrying.

Volcanoes form at tectonic plate boundaries where plates are pulling apart or pushing together, and also at 'hot spots' where magma pushes up through the middle of a plate (like Hawaii). There are three types of volcanoes: active (have erupted recently and could erupt again), dormant (have not erupted in a long time but could), and extinct (will never erupt again).

Conduction is heat moving through direct contact. When you touch a hot pan, heat moves from the pan to your hand through conduction. Metals are good conductors of heat. Convection is heat moving through liquids and gases in a circular pattern. Warm air or water rises (because it is less dense), cool air or water sinks, creating a circulation pattern.

Everything is made of atoms, and atoms contain even smaller particles: protons (positive charge), neutrons (no charge), and electrons (negative charge). Electrons orbit the outer part of atoms and can sometimes move from one atom to another. When electrons flow through a material, that flow is called electric current — and that is electricity! There are two types of electricity: static electricity and current electricity. Static electricity is a buildup of electric charge on a surface (like when you rub a balloon on your hair and it sticks). Current electricity is a continuous flow of electrons through a conductor (like electricity flowing through wires in your house). Current electricity is what powers our lights, computers, and appliances. It flows through wires from a power source (like a battery or power plant) to the device that uses it.",

Every circuit needs three things: a power source (like a battery), a conductor to carry the electricity (like a wire), and a load that uses the electricity (like a light bulb). For electricity to flow, the circuit must be complete — there cannot be any gaps. If there is a break anywhere in the circuit, electricity stops flowing and the device stops working. This is why we have switches! A switch works by opening or closing a gap in the circuit. When you flip a light switch ON, you close the circuit and electricity flows to the light. When you flip it OFF, you open the circuit and electricity stops. There are two types of circuits: series circuits (all components are connected in one loop) and parallel circuits (components are connected on separate branches).

Do not overload outlets by plugging in too many devices — this can cause wires to overheat and start a fire. Stay away from downed power lines after storms — they can carry enough electricity to be fatal. Never touch the inside of electrical devices unless they are unplugged.

            "explanation": "Our solar system is not just planets and the sun — it is also home to moons, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets. Moons are natural satellites that orbit planets. Earth has one moon, but other planets have many more — Jupiter has at least 95! Earth's Moon is about one-quarter the size of Earth and affects our tides through its gravity. Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the sun, mostly found in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. They range from small boulders to objects hundreds of miles wide. Comets are icy objects that orbit the sun in long, stretched-out paths. When a comet gets close to the sun, the ice heats up and creates a glowing tail that can be millions of miles long. Dwarf planets, like Pluto, are objects that orbit the sun and are round but have not cleared their orbital path of other debris. Pluto was reclassified from a planet to a dwarf planet in 2006.",

Liquid water is essential for life as we know it. Earth's position, along with its atmosphere, magnetic field, and tilt, creates the perfect conditions for life. Earth orbits the sun once every 365.25 days (one year) and rotates on its axis once every 24 hours (one day). The tilt of Earth's axis (about 23.5 degrees) causes the seasons. Earth's atmosphere protects us from harmful solar radiation, keeps temperatures moderate, and provides the air we breathe. Our Moon stabilizes Earth's tilt and creates ocean tides. All eight planets orbit the sun in the same direction and roughly the same plane, like a flat disk. The farther a planet is from the sun, the longer it takes to complete one orbit.",
