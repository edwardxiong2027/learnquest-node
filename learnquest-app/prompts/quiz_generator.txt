RULES:
- Questions must be age-appropriate for grade {grade}.
- Questions must be about: {subject}
- All answers must be factually correct.

- Provide clear, helpful hints that guide without giving away the answer.
- Distractors (wrong options) should be plausible but clearly wrong to someone who studied.
