## What is LearnQuest?

LearnQuest is like Khan Academy on a USB stick — but without video and with a private AI tutor. Plug it into any computer, launch it, and start learning. Everything runs locally: the AI model, the curriculum, the database, the web app. Your data never leaves the machine.

**4 subjects. 13 grade levels. 500+ lessons. Zero internet.**

| Subject | Grades | Topics |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Math | K-12 | Counting through Pre-Calculus |
| Science | K-12 | Five Senses through Earth & Environmental Science |
| ELA | K-12 | Phonics through College Prep Writing |
| Social Studies | K-12 | Community Helpers through Government & Economics |

## Features

### Learning
- **Comprehensive Curriculum** — 6-10 units per subject per grade, each with 4-6 lessons and practice problems
- **AI Tutor** — Chat with a friendly Learning Buddy that uses the Socratic method (never gives away answers)
- **AI Studio** — Generate custom lessons, quizzes, flashcards, and worksheets on any topic
- **Math Accuracy** — All math is computed by Python (fractions, algebra, trigonometry, calculus). The AI only explains — it never computes.

### Study Tools
- **Flashcards** with Leitner spaced repetition
- **Vocabulary Builder** that collects key terms from completed lessons
- **Study Timer** (Pomodoro style with XP rewards)
- **Notes & Bookmarks** on any lesson
- **Printable Worksheets** with answer keys
- **Cross-lesson Search**

### Gamification
- **XP & Levels** — 50 levels from "Number Newbie" to "LearnQuest Legend"
- **30+ Badges** — mastery, streaks, speed, exploration
- **Daily Streaks** with flame animations
- **Daily Challenge** for bonus XP
- **Leaderboard** (optional, teacher-controlled)

### Teacher Dashboard
- Add/edit/delete students (name + PIN, no email needed)
- Per-student progress reports and analytics
- Classroom mode: share a network URL so the whole class connects via WiFi
- CSV export for grade books
- Toggle gamification, leaderboard, and timer settings

## Setup Guide by Platform

### Windows

1. **Install Python 3.10+** from [python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)
   - **Important:** Check ✅ **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation
   - Verify: open Command Prompt and type `python --version`

2. **Install Ollama** from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download/windows)
   - Run the Windows installer and follow the prompts

3. **Run Setup** — Open Command Prompt, navigate to the LearnQuest folder:
   ```batch
   cd C:\LearnQuest
   python launch.py setup
   ```
   Or simply double-click **`setup.bat`**

4. **Start Learning:**
   ```batch
   python launch.py start
   ```
   Or double-click **`start.bat`**. Your browser opens to http://localhost:5001

5. **Stop:** `python launch.py stop` or double-click **`stop.bat`**

### macOS

1. **Check Python** — macOS 12+ includes Python 3. Open Terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   If not installed, download from [python.org](https://python.org/downloads)

2. **Install Ollama** from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download/mac)
   - Open the `.dmg` and drag Ollama to Applications
   - Launch Ollama once so it installs the CLI tools

3. **Run Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/LearnQuest
   python3 launch.py setup
   ```
   Or: `chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`

4. **Start Learning:**
   ```bash
   python3 launch.py start
   ```
   Or: `./start.sh` — Opens browser to http://localhost:5001

5. **Stop:** `python3 launch.py stop` or `./stop.sh`

### Linux / Chromebook

> **Chromebook:** Enable Linux first in **Settings → Advanced → Developers → Linux development environment**

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-venv git curl -y
   ```

2. **Install Ollama:**
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edwardxiong2027/LearnQuest.git
   cd LearnQuest
   python3 launch.py setup
   ```

## Setup Wizard

For a guided, interactive setup experience, run:

```bash
python launch.py wizard
```

The wizard will:
1. Detect your operating system
2. Check that Python and Ollama are installed (with instructions if not)
3. Let you pick an AI model based on your hardware
4. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies
5. Download the AI model
6. Initialize the database

**AI Model Options:**

| Model | Size | RAM | Best For |
|-------|------|-----|----------|
| Phi-3 Mini (default) | ~2.3 GB | 8 GB+ | K-12, best quality/size balance |
| Llama 3.2 1B | ~1.3 GB | 4 GB+ | K-5, low-spec machines |
| Llama 3.2 3B | ~2.0 GB | 8 GB+ | K-8, good alternative |
| Phi-3 Medium | ~7.9 GB | 16 GB+ | K-12, highest quality |

## Default Accounts

| Name | PIN | Role |
|------|-----|------|
| teacher | 1234 | Teacher |

Teachers create student accounts from the Dashboard. Students only need a name and a 4-digit PIN.

---

## Deployment Modes

### Personal Mode (default)
One student per USB. Plug into any computer and start learning. Progress is saved on the USB.

### Classroom Mode
A teacher starts LearnQuest on one computer. Students connect from their own devices over WiFi:
1. Teacher logs in → Dashboard → Classroom Setup
2. Share the network URL or QR code with students
3. Students open the URL in their browser and log in

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3 + Flask + SQLite
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript SPA (no frameworks, no build step)
- **AI**: Ollama (configurable model — Phi-3 Mini default)
- **Math**: Python `fractions` + `sympy` (deterministic, never AI-computed)
- **Hosting**: Firebase (showcase website only — the app itself is fully offline)

### Key Design Decisions
- **Math accuracy over speed**: Every math answer is computed by Python. The LLM only generates explanations and encouragement.
- **No external dependencies at runtime**: All CSS, JS, fonts, and icons are local. No CDNs.
- **Portable**: The entire app lives on the USB. Nothing installs to the host except Ollama.
- **Privacy**: No accounts, no telemetry, no data collection. Everything stays on the USB.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| App won't start | Run `python launch.py setup` again |
| AI tutor not responding | Check Ollama is running: `ollama list` |
| Slow responses | Normal — local AI takes 10-20 sec on first response |
| Port 5001 in use | `LEARNQUEST_PORT=5002 python launch.py start` |
| Python not found | Install from [python.org](https://python.org) and add to PATH |
| Ollama not found | Install from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) |
| Chromebook | Requires Linux (Crostini) enabled in settings |
